throughout period looked top economy elite must getting weaker part sort presumed focus zero-sum think is--as course point would point understands 0-sum talk shares relentlessly tend get minds focused 0-sum therefore tend miss think one aspect think thomas thomas well things like bottom bottom median gini thomas hates still useful well look top many different dimensions inequality keep track important element top might sort ring alarm bells probably--probably--related dominant economic elite society share top increasing right us worry social scientists journalists worry investigative journalism whether society increasingly dominated economically small fraction example top becoming rich time sounds eerie relevance united states--if somehow money becomes dominant might actually worry might top share increased around lot money started flowing people like sheldon adelson able sort finance particular candidates clear economic agendas gambling could something quite problematic could quite dangerous actually think explanation really worry political institutional aspects look going tax really think resilience institutions--which fault lines talked almost want bring us back beginning let close us talked said ironic--you say thinking ironic--that marx writing time wages saw presumed tomorrow going like like going perpetual course writing cusp greatest leap individual living standards human history ever kind remember graduate school 1970s wise people whose names mention explained microsoft--excuse two generations one generation ahead--how ibm threat long-running

economic political system born rich family go schools form networks get leg life always going always going privileged position even even worked even done born right think sort view many people make inequality also make equality opportunity harder think truth look world credit market easily situation--this think reality many developing countries--poor people cannot afford go people live

parenthetical comment--who cares top going make equality opportunity blacks inner cities clearly suffering poor people least educated socially economically disadvantaged part united states take money bill gates warren buffett give top course totally right thing focus really really opportunities available people bottom income top share quite bill gates--that seems word apologize overusing it--but ironic mention bill bill gates desperately trying improve schooling think good would love see smaller inequality boosting would think almost everyone great need better school nothing amount capital rich hold power third element--and think agree also perhaps might think little bit separable income political think many perhaps think overwhelming majority americans would think system handful people
