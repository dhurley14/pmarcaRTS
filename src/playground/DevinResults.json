We have admittedly (and at times deliberately) not done a great job of explaining why we have always avoided clickbait at BuzzFeed.\nIn fact \u2014 and here is a trade secret I\u2019d decided a few years ago we\u2019d be better off not revealing \u2014 clickbait stopped working around 2009.\nI avoided talking about it because, well, a lot of our rivals hadn\u2019t yet figured it out and were becoming addicted to and deeply reliant on misleading headlines; since we weren\u2019t, there seemed to be no harm (to us) in letting others focus on the short-term. But last winter saw a particularly virulent strain of hyper-optimized clickbait take root: the tempting, vacuous \u201ccuriosity gap\u201d headline. Meanwhile, the many publisher Twitter accounts that auto-tweeted dozens of misleading, over-torqued headlines became Twitter\u2019s favorite joke \u2014 and spawned a set of fairly useful \u201cspoiler\u201d accounts.\nNow it\u2019s no longer much of a secret that clickbait doesn\u2019t work. BuzzFeed News\u2019 Charlie Warzel wrote a nuanced history of the topic not long ago. The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel probably described our position better than we ever have in an interview with Poynter:\n\u201cMost clickbait is disappointing because it\u2019s a promise of value that isn\u2019t met \u2014 the payoff isn\u2019t nearly as good as what the reader imagines,\u201d Patel said. \u201cBuzzFeed headlines pay off particularly well because they actually make fairly small promises and then overdeliver.\u201d\nIn a blog post in August, Facebook engineer Khalid El-Arini made clear what we all know: that readers don\u2019t want to be tricked by headlines; instead, they want to be informed by them.\nThe origins of clickbait\nClickbait actually has its origins in old media, not the web, and specifically in the don\u2019t-touch-that-dial antics of television and radio. Because you won\u2019t believe what happens next\u2026after the break. It\u2019s a pretty rough consumer experience to demand your audience sit through an ad, online or off. The banner ad, whose decline Farhad Manjoo recently celebrated, was also born during this era and created a business model in which clicks are tied directly to dollars \u2014 something many people assume is still how all online publishers make their money. But BuzzFeed has never sold a banner, and I couldn\u2019t even tell you how many monthly page views we get. And so our business model at least moderates that incentive to drag every last click out of our audience.\nThe worst form of this online is on a pennies-per-click business model in the transactional netherworld of outsourced sponsored content sitting at the bottom of articles around the web. All that matters in that space is the snappy headline. Grab the reader\u2019s attention, get the click \u2014 even if this isn\u2019t the craziest thing Ted Cruz has said yet; even if \u201cParis Hilton \u2013 topless\u201d is in fact demurely dressed and riding in a convertible; if this one easy trick won\u2019t actually lose you weight; and if you actually can believe what happens next.\nYou can trick someone to click, but you can\u2019t trick someone to share\nIf your goal \u2014 as is ours at BuzzFeed \u2014 is to deliver the reader something so new, funny, revelatory, or delightful that they feel compelled to share it, you have to do work that delivers on the headline\u2019s promise, and more. This is a very high bar. It\u2019s one thing to enjoy reading something, and quite another to make the active choice to share it with your friends. This is a core fact of sharing and the social web of Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other platforms.\nThe best way to ensure your readers won\u2019t choose to share a story or a post is to trick them. Anyone who has spent the last 20 years online knows the specific disgust that comes with a headline that doesn\u2019t deliver on its promise. It\u2019s the kind of taste you get in your mouth from a glistening but spoiled peach. The publisher got the page view, and ComScore doesn\u2019t record your flash of anger. But you\u2019re hardly going to subject your friends to this experience. (Maybe your enemies.)\nWhat makes a great headline\nIn fact, the only real trick is that the work has to be good. And the only thing, other than mediocrity, that can really sabotage this strategy is writing a headline that overpromises and a story that underdelivers.\nGreat headlines, meanwhile, tell you a lot about what you\u2019re going to read, and persuade you to click because you know you\u2019ll find a story that will satisfy your interest. The lists that BuzzFeed has long been known for are, as list titles tend to be, extremely direct; \u201c31 Genius Hacks For Your Elementary School Art Class\u201d is just that. As my colleague Ryan Broderick puts it, the goal is often, in fact, to \u201cblow away the curiosity gap.\u201d One of his recent headlines: \u201cA 5-Year-Old Girl Raised Enough Money To Take Her Father Who Has Terminal Cancer To Disney World.\u201d\nThe web\u2019s new allergy to clickbait applies, I should add, to those of us who are also working to build great front pages in addition to content for the social web. Most people don\u2019t click on most headlines, but a good front page will inform you without forcing you to click. Vice\u2019s incredible 2014 series \u201cThe Islamic State\u201d was, if anything, underhyped. And you may not be among the many people who read Jina Moore\u2019s recent dispatch headline, \u201cIn Liberia, Everyone Says Ebola Cases Are Dropping\u201d \u2014 but if you saw the headline, you still learned something. A headline like \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what happened to this Ebola hospital\u201d might (maybe) get more clicks \u2014 but the reader who scans it gets nothing at all. It\u2019s a form of pollution wherever it lives, whether on your homepage or your Twitter or Facebook feed.\nDifferent people use the term \u201cclickbait\u201d differently, and it\u2019s sometimes thrown our direction to characterize entertaining web culture content that the author doesn\u2019t like. That is something different, a matter of taste. But whatever your taste, nobody likes being tricked. And whatever your goals as a publisher, there\u2019s no longer any argument for breaking promises to your readers.","discussion":{"title":"Why BuzzFeed Doesn\u2019t Do Clickbait","numPosts":19,"diffbotUri":"discussion|3|-612889628","pageUrl":"http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/why-buzzfeed-doesnt-do-clickbait","posts":[{"id":0,"author":"Heath Farnsworth-Williams","parentId":0,"text":"http://www.buzzfeed.com/search?q=you+won%27t+believe","diffbotUri":"post|3|1143443228","html":"<p><a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dyou%2Bwon%2527t%2Bbelieve&h=1AQHwRnAD&s=1\">http://www.buzzfeed.com/search?q=you+won%27t+believe<\/a><\/p>","date":"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 13:28:00 GMT","type":"post"},{"id":1,"author":"Isaac Mosh","parentId":0,"text":"thank you for this","diffbotUri":"post|3|-1677067284","html":"<p>thank you for this<\/p>","date":"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 13:39:00 GMT","type":"post"},{"id":2,"author":"Andrew Yueh","parentId":0,"text":"Most of those use that phrase in lieu of \"really cool\".

We have admittedly (and at times deliberately) not done a great job of explaining why we have always avoided clickbait at BuzzFeed.<\/p>\n<p>In fact &mdash; and here is a trade secret I&rsquo;d decided a few years ago we&rsquo;d be better off not revealing &mdash; clickbait stopped working around 2009.<\/p>\n<p>I avoided talking about it because, well, a lot of our rivals hadn&rsquo;t yet figured it out and were becoming addicted to and deeply reliant on misleading headlines; since we weren&rsquo;t, there seemed to be no harm (to us) in letting others focus on the short-term. But last winter saw a particularly virulent strain of hyper-optimized clickbait take root: the tempting, vacuous &ldquo;curiosity gap&rdquo; headline. Meanwhile, the many publisher Twitter accounts that auto-tweeted dozens of misleading, over-torqued headlines became Twitter&rsquo;s favorite joke &mdash; and spawned a set of fairly useful &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s no longer much of a secret that clickbait doesn&rsquo;t work. BuzzFeed News&rsquo; Charlie Warzel wrote a <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/please-stop-saving-me-a-click\">nuanced history<\/a> of the topic not long ago. <i>The Verge<\/i>&rsquo;s Nilay Patel probably described our position better than we ever have in <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/258985/the-real-problem-with-clickbait/\">an interview with Poynter:<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Most clickbait is disappointing because it&rsquo;s a promise of value that isn&rsquo;t met &mdash; the payoff isn&rsquo;t nearly as good as what the reader imagines,&rdquo; Patel said. &ldquo;BuzzFeed headlines pay off particularly well because they actually make fairly small promises and then overdeliver.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/08/news-feed-fyi-click-baiting/\">In a blog post<\/a> in August, Facebook engineer Khalid El-Arini made clear what we all know: that readers don&rsquo;t want to be tricked by headlines; instead, they want to be informed by them.<\/p>\n<p><b>The origins of clickbait<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Clickbait actually has its origins in old media, not the web, and specifically in the don&rsquo;t-touch-that-dial antics of television and radio. Because you won&rsquo;t believe what happens next&hellip;after the break. It&rsquo;s a pretty rough consumer experience to demand your audience sit through an ad, online or off. The banner ad, whose decline Farhad Manjoo recently <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/technology/personaltech/banner-ads-the-monsters-that-swallowed-the-web.html?_r=0\">celebrated<\/a>, was also born during this era and created a business model in which clicks are tied directly to dollars &mdash; something many people assume is still how all online publishers make their money. But BuzzFeed has never sold a banner, and I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you how many monthly page views we get. And so our business model at least moderates that incentive to drag every last click out of our audience.<\/p>\n<p>The worst form of this online is on a pennies-per-click business model in the transactional netherworld of outsourced sponsored content sitting at the bottom of articles around the web. All that matters in that space is the snappy headline. Grab the reader&rsquo;s attention, get the click &mdash; even if this isn&rsquo;t the craziest thing Ted Cruz has said yet; even if &ldquo;Paris Hilton &ndash; topless&rdquo; is in fact demurely dressed and riding in a convertible; if this one easy trick won&rsquo;t actually lose you weight; and if you actually <i>can<\/i> believe what happens next.<\/p>\n<p><b>You can trick someone to click, but you can&rsquo;t trick someone to share<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If your goal &mdash; as is ours at BuzzFeed &mdash; is to deliver the reader something so new, funny, revelatory, or delightful that they feel compelled to share it, you have to do work that delivers on the headline&rsquo;s promise, and more. This is a very high bar. It&rsquo;s one thing to enjoy reading something, and quite another to make the active choice to share it with your friends. This is a core fact of sharing and the social web of Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other platforms.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to ensure your readers <i>won&rsquo;t<\/i> choose to share a story or a post is to trick them. Anyone who has spent the last 20 years online knows the specific disgust that comes with a headline that doesn&rsquo;t deliver on its promise. It&rsquo;s the kind of taste you get in your mouth from a glistening but spoiled peach. The publisher got the page view, and ComScore doesn&rsquo;t record your flash of anger. But you&rsquo;re hardly going to subject your friends to this experience. (Maybe your enemies.)<\/p>\n<p><b>What makes a great headline<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In fact, the only real trick is that the work has to be good.

This post elaborates, putting the sceptical side of the QE story that the MPC has sidestepped. None of these sceptical arguments are original, and all have been made before by people higher up the food chain than I. I don\u2019t go through the arguments in favour in great detail, as this side of the story has already been told.\nThere are two main pieces of evidence in favour of QE having been the right . One is the accumulated \u2018event study\u2019 analysis of the effects of tranches of QE on gilt yields, not just in the UK, but also in the US and Japan. Event studies measure yields just before a QE announcement is made, and then just after. By timing the measurements tightly around the announcements, they try to isolate the effects of QE from all the other market news on yields. These effects are extensively documented in BoE work, and also good work by the New York Fed and the BoJ. The other piece of evidence is more circumstancial, but powerful nonetheless \u2013 we have had high and relatively stable inflation for several years despite interest rates hitting their natural floor.\nHowever.\n1. It is possible, even likely, that this effect on yields was not persistent. Temporary effects on yields could be explained by changes in beliefs by particpants in gilt markets about resting places for prices and premia; and changes in what they inferred from the QE operations about the likely path of future rates. Other commentators have referred to this as a \u2018signalling\u2019 channel; QE simply signalled the authorities determination to keep rates low, or revealed private information the authorities had about just how bad the economy was (and therefore how unlikely interest rates were to rise). The temporariness of the effect on yields would not itself be a cast iron argument for not doing QE; there are circumstances where you would proceed anyway, expanding QE by ever more. (Perhaps this is behind the Fed\u2019s constant rate of asset purchases policy, rather than MPC\u2019s constant level policy). However, if QE is really about signalling the path of future interest rates, it raises the possibility that what the MPC should have done was, well, explain their path for future interest rates, rather than do it so indirectly. Signalling directly would be i) less confusing, ii) lead to less uncertainty about future rates, a good thing in itself, iii) help with any credibility issues, since the progress of actual rates can be monitored. Another explanation for the temporary effect on yields is that for a while people thought \u2018perhaps this will work\u2019, but then later realised it would not. This is one explanation for why the effect seems stronger for earlier QE announcements than later ones, (an explanation carefully avoided in the BoE studies), though there are others, more supportive of QE, namely, that the early announcements were more of a surprise, while the later ones were largely expected. (That they were expected doesn\u2019t mean they had any less of an effect, as if QE had not been implemented as expected, yields could have been higher).\n2. Even if QE did affect yields, it doesn\u2019t follow that it lowered the rates anyone in the private sector pays to borrow, other things equal. Vissing-Jorgensen and Krishnamurthy dissect the effects of QE and argues that purchases of US Treasuries simply widened the spread between those and other riskier assets. On the contrary, purchases of the debt of the mortgage backing agencies did lower the yields on those assets. Michael Woodford makes this point too in his Jackson Hole paper.\n3. Even if QE did have an effect on bond yields, and even if that was passed on into yields on other assets, it doesn\u2019t follow from this that it was socially beneficial. The MPC have many times told a story that runs something like this; we make gilts more scarce, this pushes previous holders of gilts to hold something else more risky, like equities or coporate bonds. The prices of those assets rise, and that lowers the cost of funding for corporates. This boosts investment spending, employment, output, and everyone is better off. So it might. But, it also deprives the holders of gilts of something they wanted. If the government were to buy up the stock of oranges, orange-lovers would move into grapefruit, and the price of grapefruit would rise, and grapefruit growers would enjoy a boom, but orange lovers would be poorer for it, no longer able to enjoy that sweet taste so cheaply. Some of those desparate for citrus of any kind would buy grapefruit and eat them, and we would see their pain and disappointment written into their sour faces. This point is made forcefully (without the silly fruit analogy) in work by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen. The logical corollary of this argument is that we need not QE but negative QE, with the proceeds invested in a risky asset. We need to expand the supply of safe assets, by over-financing government borrowing needs, and take risk, notwithstanding worries about public sector credit-worthiness, onto the government balance sheet. Pressurising those in the private sector already struggling to bear risk to bear more of it makes them worse off. This said, the mere existence of these costs doesn\u2019t imply that they dominate potential benefits of QE. But they might.\n4. A sceptical argument that I anticipate will alienate some readers, and must nonplus BoE policymakers by their revealed preference for QE, is that there is no sound theoretical account of why QE should work. By sound, I mean one that meets the standards of modern macroeconomic theory, which places a premium on assuming the minimum, making explicit what agents are doing in the economy and why, and works out the effects by adding up the behaviours of all the agents in the economy. On the contrary, all the models of monetary policy that we do have suggest that QE should be impotent. Michael Woodford explains this point, in his Jackson Hole paper, and in several before that. These models are probably wrong too, and not to be taken literally. But they at least provide a cautionary note. Non-economists might find it amusing to hear the old joke about economists (that they are people who see whether something that works in pratise also works in theory) turning out to be true. Isn\u2019t it specious to insist on theory when you have empirical and common sense insights on your side? Robert Lucas got his nobel prize, in part, for his explanation for why this is important. If you rely solely on data-based insights, and stop trying to understand what the people in the model you have are doing, you might find the correlations they embody crumbling when you try to exploit them. Also, if you fail to try to formalise your stories, you run the risk of being fooled by a story that sounds good but is just internally inconsistent or wrong. In defence of this philosophy, many MPC prounouncements in the past have followed this kind of reasoning, and the same notion lies behind the construction of the Bank\u2019s new model COMPASS.\n5. On the contrary, the monetary models we do have suggest that QE does not work. What happens is this: at the zero bound, swapping money for bonds is swapping one default-risk-free, zero-interest-rate asset for another, and not to be expected to have any effect. (Using the fruit analogy above, QE is swapping oranges for oranges !) Money\u2019s usefulness derives from it offering a cheap, quick and easy way to transform it into something you can eat or use. But if you have enough of it on hand anyway, more money isn\u2019t going to be useful. You have enough to see you through. Hence money is just like a gilt at this point. It\u2019s just another safe way to store your wealth. Why should swapping something almost like a gilt for a gilt change anything? Robert Lucas, Godfather of modern macro, and Nobel laureate, explained the very same argument in a recent WSJ article. [He\u2019s in favour of the Fed QE program, but because they are buying illiquid agency bonds]. In these models, QE will work to the extent that markets think the operation will not be reversed and that that will impy lower interest rates than would be expected given likely rules for setting interest rates. (Because rates would have to be higher, in order for markets to want the extra money). This is why some think that the empirical evidence showing QE does something indicates a \u2018signalling\u2019 effect. And why if this was the motive, explaining precisely what the implication was for future interest rates would have been a better policy. Perhaps we will one day find a sound theoretical explanation for why QE works. But if we do, we can\u2019t guarantee even that it will tell us even that we should do more of it in a recession, not less. And that same theory might overturn all that policymakers use to inform the setting of their conventional interest rate instrument, or even that interest rates should be the normal policy insrument.\n6. On many occasions, MPC emphasised the importance of expanding the money supply, precisely the mechanism that the models we have says is ineffective. The first mention is in the March 2009 MPC minutes, where we read: \u2018the Committee had previously chosen to influence the amount of nominal spending in the economy by varying the price at which it supplied central bank money in exchange for assets held by the private sector\u2026. [now]\u2026the Committee would instead be focusing more directly on the quantity of money it supplied in exchange for assets held by the private sector\u2026 By increasing the supply of money in the ec onomy, these operations should, over time, cause nominal spending to rise.\u2019 [Ref 1 linked to below]. That\u2019s ok then: the message is: monetary policy is simply about varying the supply of money, which before we did by changing the price, now we do by changing the quantity when the price is pinned at zero. The argument appears in later documents too. For example: \u2018The purpose of the purchases was and is to inject money directly into the economy in order to boost nominal demand\u2018, [Ref 2]. \u2018Increases in money should eventually lead to a rise in prices\u2018, [Ref 3], which states the fallacy more explicitly, neglecting to note that this relationship is probably true, except at the zero lower bound to interest rates. What monetary economists would have found astonishing is that nowhere in these early deliberations and communications is there an explanation of, or even an attempt to evaluate and discard the account of what happens at the zero bound in monetary macroeconomic models. The MPC might have worried that by disclosing that an unpleasant feature of its own monetary model, (in fact all monetary models), a feature that implied that QE would not work, this would make it less likely that QE would work, panicking the markets. But there was a contending risk, that MPC would look like it did not understand monetary economics. Whatever, MPC seem to have got away with it.\n7. The Bank\u2019s presenation of the evidence is accompanied by verbal accounts of why and how QE should work which are inappropriately confident, and no airtime is given to more sceptical, contrary thinking. The Bank\u2019s empirical work forms an impressive body. But in some senses it is a whitewash; it gives inadequate attention to sceptical readings of the evidence, and presents verbal accounts of the intuition for why these effects should be taken at face value [ie as persistent, and to be regarded as beneficial] with a confidence that is inappropriate (given the practice at large in the profession of not doing this unless there is consensus and or confirmatory theoretical accounts of the same effects seen in the data). Imaginative conjecture is recounted as conclusive, almost formal analysis. To give some examples: \u2018Purchases of financial assets financed by central bank money should initially increase broad money holdings, push up asset prices and stimulate expenditure by lowering borrowing costs and increasing wealth. Asset purchases may also have a stimulatory impact through their broader effects on expectations and by influencing bank lending, though this channel would not be expected to be material during times of financial crisis.\u2018 [Ref: 2] (It sounds good, and makes you think we know the answer, but we don\u2019t. We can\u2019t even check that it holds water theoretically.)\nThis unfortunate policy [of sweeping aside worries about QE\u2019s effectiveness] can even be found in the official response to the request to investigate the \u2018distributional effects of asset purchases\u2019, in particular claims that (eg) pensioners were being adversely affected. That response did not appraise the reader that the assertion that QE had worked was highly contentious. An alternative reading of QE is that it might well have lowered yields on government bonds on which many savers live, and entirely in vain, for it may not have had any effect on anything else. No weight is put on that argument in the Bank\u2019s official response, nor on the argument that there is even a case, as explained above, for engaging in negative QE. Thus, in the introduction to \u2018The distributional effects of asset purchases\u2019 we read : \u2018Without the Bank\u2019s asset purchases, most people in the United Kingdom would have been worse off. Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. Many more companies would have gone out of business.\u2018 Well, maybe, but maybe not! Perhaps we are about as well off as if they didn\u2019t happen?!\nIt\u2019s not true that uncerainty is ignored entirely in BoE material. For example, one can find several references like this in the Bank\u2019s survey of the evidence: \u2018It is difficult to measure directly the effects of policy measures such as QE and so estimates of those effects are highly uncertain\u2018 [Ref 4]. But, the overriding impression we are directed to, not least since the MPC\u2019s QE (and QE only) actions (and MPC minutes) speak just as loudly, is that it works, and so much better than any other option, that other policies are not even worth considering. This quote is illustrative: \u2018evidence suggests that the policy had economically significant effects \u2013 equivalent to a cut of 150 to 300 basis points in Bank Rate \u2013 but there is considerable uncertainty around the precise magnitude of the impact.\u2019 Which I read to mean; ok, the precise magnitude is not certain, but we are pretty sure it worked, big-time!\nThis failure to provide a more balanced account of QE might have been motivated by a desire to instill confidence. But ultimately, it undermines the authority with which the Bank\u2019s voice speaks on technical matters, and will increase the chance that future such documents are not taken at face value, but as energetic and adversarial attempts to justify a particular course of action.\n8. QE was not a rational policy at the outset, when the (for some) supportive event study analysis was not yet available. Suppose you adopt the position that history has proved the MPC right, and QE effective. And you dismiss all the contrary arguments set out above. Still, at the time the MPC first embarked on it, we did not have the supportive event study analysis that QE might lower yields. [The introduction of the corporate paper facility can be set aside as a detail, since it was never intended, and never evolved into a way to intervene on a large scale]. The examples we did have were the old evidence on operation twist in the 60s, which at that time showed very little effect of changing maturities in the hands of the private secor [effects revised up since in work by Swanson], and the evidence of Japan, which was singularly unencouraging. There were other possible reasons for the failure in Japan, but at least one possibility was that QE had little or no effect. The only thing in favour of QE was the belief that although our monetary models said that the power of money injections to generate inflation was undermined by the zero bound, there was something different about the real world which meant that monetary injections still had potency. So, faced with many possible options at the zero boud, the MPC chose to place almost all its eggs in an extremely unpromising basket. One can argue that empirical evidence has proven them right, but that does not rationalise the decision made initially, before this evidence existed.\n9. Other more promising alternatives were inappropriately discarded. There were two other promising alternatives to QE at the time: forward guidance on interest rates, and credit easing, or large scale purchases of private assets. Both were discarded. In the March 2009 minutes, I can\u2019t see any discussion of forward guidance at all, though from Spencer Dale\u2019s speech later that year, we can guess at what the consensus view might have been. As for private sector assets, there is some discussion of this, but the decision about what to buy is described as secondary to the decision about how much to buy (something that is a corrollary of believing that it\u2019s not the nature of the assets the central bank takes on its balance sheet that matters, but the quantity of monetary liabilities it creates, something I view as a mistake, as explained earlier).\n10. The BoE executive railroaded the external MPC members over who does what, based on the faulty logic that only the size of the balance sheet mattered. Judging from the March 2009 minutes, and subsequent votes on asset purchases, it\u2019s clear that the practice was settled on whereby the MPC decide on the quantum of QE, and the executive decide what to buy with the proceeds. The MPC appear to have submitted to this when there was no unambiuous, legal reason in the Bank of England Act for them to do so. It was also illogical, as though the quantum was all that needed to be decided in order to best hit the MPCs remit, and the asset purchases themselves were a technical detail best left to market experts. This reasoning is unsound. Not only because the quantity of monetary liabilities created might well have been irrelevant. But also because purchases of private sector assets could have substantial beneficial supply side effects, boosting credit supply, supply itself, and perhaps even lowering inflation. [The opposite perhaps of the constriction to credit that constituted the financial crisis the MPC were trying to combat]. The matter of whether one embarks on a trade-off improving policy intervention (credit easing) as against a trade-off preserving one would seem to be exactly what the MPC should be deciding on collectively, and not an implementation matter for the exeuctive of the BoE only. I recall that this operating procedure (as well as the focus on gilts) was questioned in public by Adam Posen, but others appear to have gone along with it. It\u2019s a shame that HMT\u2019s review of the MPCs remit, published in March this year, did not take the chance to codify these responsiblities properly.\nRef 1: MPC minutes, 4,5 March 2009, paras 30/31.\nRef 2: Quantitative easing explained\nRef 3: \u2018The UK\u2019s quantitative easing policy: design, operation and impact\u2019, p201\nRef 4: \u2018The distributional effects of asset purchases\u2019, p1.\nRef 5: Same as Ref 3, but p204.\nLoading...","title":"A sceptic\u2019s view of QE, an initially irrational policy, the controversies over which were whitewashed","diffbotUri":"article|3|1812012926","pageUrl":"http://t.co/jtakKBnLcV","humanLanguage":"en","html":"<p>I am, and always have been, dubious about the usefulness of QE, and regret the process by which the Bank and the MPC decided to embark on it, and gave overly confident accounts of how it worked and its impact.&nbsp; This post elaborates, putting the sceptical side of the QE story that the MPC has sidestepped.&nbsp; None of these sceptical arguments are original, and all have been made before by people higher up the food chain than I.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t go through the arguments in favour in great detail, as this side of the story has already been told.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main pieces of evidence in favour of QE having been the right .&nbsp; One is the accumulated &lsquo;event study&rsquo; analysis of the effects of tranches of QE on gilt yields, not just in the UK, but also in the US and Japan.&nbsp; Event studies measure yields just before a QE announcement is made, and then just after.&nbsp; By timing the measurements tightly around the announcements, they try to isolate the effects of QE from all the other market news on yields.&nbsp; These effects are extensively documented in BoE work, and also good work by the New York Fed and the BoJ.&nbsp; The other piece of evidence is more circumstancial, but powerful nonetheless &ndash; we have had high and relatively stable inflation for several years despite interest rates hitting their natural floor.<\/p>\n<p>However.<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>It is possible, even likely, that this effect on yields was not persistent.<\/strong>&nbsp; Temporary effects on yields could be explained by changes in beliefs by particpants in gilt markets about resting places for prices and premia;&nbsp; and changes in what they inferred from the QE operations about the likely path of future rates.&nbsp; Other commentators have referred to this as a &lsquo;signalling&rsquo; channel;&nbsp; QE simply signalled the authorities determination to keep rates low, or revealed private information the authorities had about just how bad the economy was (and therefore how unlikely interest rates were to rise).&nbsp; The temporariness of the effect on yields would not itself be a cast iron argument for not doing QE;&nbsp; there are circumstances where you would proceed anyway, expanding QE by ever more.&nbsp; (Perhaps this is behind the Fed&rsquo;s constant rate of asset purchases policy, rather than MPC&rsquo;s constant level policy).&nbsp; However, if QE is really about signalling the path of future interest rates, it raises the possibility that what the MPC should have done was, well, explain their path for future interest rates, rather than do it so indirectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Signalling directly would be i) less confusing, ii) lead to less uncertainty about future rates, a good thing in itself, iii) help with any credibility issues, since the progress of actual rates can be monitored.&nbsp; Another explanation for the temporary effect on yields is that for a while people thought &lsquo;perhaps this will work&rsquo;, but then later realised it would not.&nbsp; This is one explanation for why the effect seems stronger for earlier QE announcements than later ones, (an explanation carefully avoided in the BoE studies), though there are others, more supportive of QE, namely, that the early announcements were more of a surprise, while the later ones were largely expected.&nbsp; (That they were expected doesn&rsquo;t mean they had any less of an effect, as if QE had not been implemented as expected, yields could have been higher).<\/p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; <strong>Even if QE did affect yields, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that it lowered the rates anyone in the private sector pays to borrow, other things equal.&nbsp;

<strong>Even if QE <em>did<\/em> have an effect on bond yields, and even if that <em>was<\/em> passed on into yields on other assets, it doesn&rsquo;t follow from this that it was socially beneficial.<\/strong>&nbsp; The MPC have many times told a story that runs something like this;&nbsp; we make gilts more scarce, this pushes previous holders of gilts to hold something else more risky, like equities or coporate bonds.&nbsp; The prices of those assets rise, and that lowers the cost of funding for corporates.&nbsp; This boosts investment spending, employment, output, and everyone is better off.&nbsp; So it might.&nbsp; But, it also deprives the holders of gilts of something they wanted.&nbsp; If the government were to buy up the stock of oranges, orange-lovers would move into grapefruit, and the price of grapefruit would rise, and grapefruit growers would enjoy a boom, but orange lovers would be poorer for it, no longer able to enjoy that sweet taste so cheaply.&nbsp; Some of those desparate for citrus of any kind would buy grapefruit and eat them, and we would see their pain and disappointment written into their sour faces.&nbsp; This point is made forcefully (without the silly fruit analogy) in work by <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall%202011/2011b_bpea_krishnamurthy.PDF\">Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen.&nbsp;<\/a> The logical corollary of this argument is that we need not QE but negative QE, with the proceeds invested in a risky asset.&nbsp; We need to expand the supply of safe assets, by over-financing government borrowing needs, and take risk, notwithstanding worries about public sector credit-worthiness, onto the government balance sheet.&nbsp; Pressurising those in the private sector already struggling to bear risk to bear more of it makes them worse off.&nbsp; This said, the mere existence of these costs doesn&rsquo;t imply that they dominate potential benefits of QE.&nbsp; But they might.<\/p>\n<p>4.&nbsp; A sceptical argument that I anticipate will alienate some readers, and must nonplus BoE policymakers by their revealed preference for QE, is that <strong>there is no sound theoretical account of why QE should work.<\/strong>&nbsp; By sound, I mean one that meets the standards of modern macroeconomic theory, which places a premium on assuming the minimum, making explicit what agents are doing in the economy and why, and works out the effects by adding up the behaviours of all the agents in the economy. &nbsp; On the contrary, all the models of monetary policy that we do have suggest that QE should be impotent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/mw.pdf\">Michael Woodford explains this point, in his Jackson Hole paper, and in several before that.<\/a>&nbsp; These models are probably wrong too, and not to be taken literally.&nbsp; But they at least provide a cautionary note. &nbsp; Non-economists might find it amusing to hear the old joke about economists (that they are people who see whether something that works in pratise also works in theory) turning out to be true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it specious to insist on theory when you have empirical and common sense insights on your side?&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Lucas got his nobel prize, in part, for his explanation for why this is important.&nbsp; If you rely solely on data-based insights, and stop trying to understand what the people in the model you have are doing, you might find the correlations they embody crumbling when you try to exploit them.&nbsp; Also, if you fail to try to formalise your stories, you run the risk of being fooled by a story that sounds good but is just internally inconsistent or wrong.&nbsp; In defence of this philosophy, many MPC prounouncements in the past have followed this kind of reasoning, and the same notion lies behind the construction of the Bank&rsquo;s new model COMPASS.<\/p>\n<p>5.&nbsp; <strong>On the contrary, the monetary models we do have suggest that QE does not work.<\/strong>&nbsp; What happens is this:&nbsp; at the zero bound, swapping money for bonds is swapping one default-risk-free, zero-interest-rate asset for another, and not to be expected to have any effect.&nbsp; (Using the fruit analogy above, QE is swapping oranges for oranges !)&nbsp;&nbsp; Money&rsquo;s usefulness derives from it offering a cheap, quick and easy way to transform it into something you can eat or use.&nbsp; But if you have enough of it on hand anyway, more money isn&rsquo;t going to be useful. &nbsp; You have enough to see you through.&nbsp; Hence money is just like a gilt at this point. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s just another safe way to store your wealth.&nbsp; Why should swapping something almost like a gilt for a gilt change anything?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Lucas, Godfather of modern macro, and Nobel laureate, explained the very same argument <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122999959052129273.html\">in a recent WSJ article.<\/a>&nbsp; [He&rsquo;s in favour of the Fed QE program, but because they are buying illiquid agency bonds].&nbsp; In these models, QE will work to the extent that markets think the operation will not be reversed and that that will impy lower interest rates than would be expected given likely rules for setting interest rates.&nbsp;

Tuesday and Wednesday are worse, the regular drivers say, and so is Thursday. On Friday it lets up, but not much. Everyday traffic is worse than it was last year and the year before that and the year before that.\nThis is the most frustrating gauge of just how hot Silicon Valley\u2019s economy is right now.\nOut here it\u2019s easy to forget there was ever a Great Recession, or why so many Americans believe that recession still isn\u2019t over. The metro area that the 101 freeway bisects added 30,000 new jobs in the past year, a 3.5 percent increase from September 2013.\nAll those jobs, and the salaries and stock options that come with so many of them, are powering California to a respectable recovery and a balanced budget. The state as a whole has a falling unemployment rate and 100,000 more jobs today than it did at its pre-recession peak in 2008. But if the San Jose and San Francisco areas didn\u2019t exist, the state would still be 80,000 jobs down from its \u201908 peak.\nA similar story is playing out around the nation: Big metro areas are mostly booming after the recession, and everywhere else is still digging out.\nAs of the third quarter of this year, according to a Brookings analysis of Moody\u2019s Analytics data, America\u2019s 100 largest metro areas were collectively 1.3 million jobs over their pre-recession peak. All the other parts of the country, combined, were still 300,000 jobs below peak. That\u2019s a 1.5 percent gain for the big metros and a 0.7 percent loss for everywhere else. The gap would be much wider if not for an oil- and gas-drilling bonanza that is lifting job growth in North Dakota and other largely rural areas.\nThis isn\u2019t how the economy typically worked over the last 35 years. Calculations made earlier this year by state economists in Oregon show that big cities tended to grow at rate similar to other areas of the country after a recession. Only the late 1990s were an exception. Until now.\nThose diverging fortunes help explain why people in broad swaths of the country perceive that the recession, which ended officially in mid-2009, still hasn\u2019t loosened its grip on their lives. Rural areas without oil or gas reserves have on average only recovered one-fifth to one-quarter of the jobs they lost during the crisis, according to calculations by Joshua Lehner, an economist for the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis.\n\u201cIn an ideal world,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019d have jobs for everyone that wanted them\u201d \u2013 regardless of where they live.\nIt may be that this geographic jobs gap is a permanent feature in an economy increasingly driven by brainpower and innovation, where clustering smart people in relatively small areas appears to boost labor productivity. That\u2019s certainly what the economists think at the Brookings Metropolitan Program, which conducted its breakdown of job growth at the request of The Washington Post.\n\u201cScale and density concentrate economic inputs like skilled people and R&D, intensify interactions, allow for labor market pooling and matching, allow for access to shared infrastructure,\u201d said Mark Muro, the metro program\u2019s policy director. \u201cThis a fact of economic life. Place, scale and density matter.\u201d\nOr, says, Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the online real estate site Trulia, it could be that there\u2019s nothing new here, other than that some parts of the country are just correcting the excesses of the last housing bubble. \u201cWe need to be further outside of this economic cycle before we can say whether there\u2019s been a permanent shift in the past few years,\u201d he said.\nIn California, researchers are beginning to worry that the economy and the state budget depend too heavily on Silicon Valley. It\u2019s easy to imagine a cascade where tech growth slows, employees cash in fewer stock options and capital gains receipts fall, plunging the state back into the sort of budgetary trouble that plagued it throughout the 2000s.\nOddly enough, government budget cuts may be one driver of the big metro/everyone else disparity. Smaller communities tend to have less diverse economies than major cities, Lehner said, and so when cuts force layoffs of teachers and civil servants, those smaller areas have fewer other jobs to cushion them. That\u2019s a factor in his state, Oregon, where Portland has gained back all its lost jobs, plus two percent, while the rest of the state is still four percent below its jobs peak.\nThat brings up another concern about growth being concentrated in big metro areas: They tend to be more unequal and expensive places to live. Income inequality runs very high in Silicon Valley and many other large metros. Palo Alto residents love to talk about the bidding wars on their blocks, with multimillion-dollar homes being bought entirely for cash. Home prices are up more than five percent over the last year in Portland, Ore. Trulia reported Tuesday that homes are getting less affordable for the middle class, especially in high-income areas.\nWhen jobs are concentrated in pricier areas, workers often face a choice: Accept a more expensive life or drive longer to get to work. Many of them choose the commute \u2013 which means more traffic, on the 101 and elsewhere.\nJim Tankersley is the editor of Storyline, where he explains complex public policies and illuminates their human impact. He's from Oregon, and he misses it.\n1\nComments","title":"Big cities are dominating the recovery, leaving the rest of America behind","diffbotUri":"article|3|-1836027036","pageUrl":"http://t.co/JvJHEGJRmx","images":[{"title":" The San Jose skyline is seen from City Hall in San Jose, Calif., Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2013.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>PALO ALTO, Calif. &ndash; Monday traffic is brutal&nbsp;on U.S.&nbsp;101 between&nbsp;San Francisco and&nbsp;San Jose, choking the commute&nbsp;to Google and Facebook&nbsp;and hundreds&nbsp;of startups you&rsquo;ve never heard of. Tuesday and Wednesday are&nbsp;worse, the regular drivers say, and so is Thursday. On Friday it lets up, but not much. Everyday traffic is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/sysmgtpl/MPR/index.htm#FwyCong\">&nbsp;worse<\/a> than it was last year and the year before that and the year before that.<\/p>\n<p>This is the&nbsp;most frustrating gauge of just how hot Silicon Valley&rsquo;s economy&nbsp;is right now.<\/p>\n<p>Out here it&rsquo;s easy to&nbsp;forget there was ever a Great Recession, or why so many Americans believe that recession still isn&rsquo;t over. The&nbsp;metro area that the 101 freeway bisects added 30,000 new jobs in the past year, a 3.5 percent increase from September 2013<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All those jobs, and the salaries and stock options that come with so many of them, are powering California to a respectable recovery and a balanced budget. The state as a whole has a falling unemployment rate and 100,000 more jobs today than it did at its pre-recession peak in 2008. But if the San Jose and San Francisco areas didn&rsquo;t exist, the state would still be&nbsp;80,000 jobs <em>down<\/em> from its &rsquo;08 peak.<\/p>\n<p>A similar story is playing out around the nation: Big metro areas&nbsp;are mostly booming after the recession, and everywhere else is still digging out.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2014/11/BrookingsMetro.jpg&w=1484\"><\/img><figcaption> Since the Great Recession ended, the largest 100 metro areas in America have regained jobs substantially faster than every other part of the country. (Source: Brookings analysis of Moody&rsquo;s Analytics data) <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As of the third quarter of this year, according to a Brookings analysis of Moody&rsquo;s Analytics data, America&rsquo;s 100 largest metro areas were&nbsp;collectively 1.3 million jobs over their pre-recession peak. All the other parts of&nbsp;the country, combined, were still 300,000 jobs below peak. That&rsquo;s a 1.5 percent gain for the big metros and a 0.7 percent loss for everywhere else. The gap would be much wider if not for an oil- and gas-drilling bonanza that is lifting job growth in North Dakota and other largely rural areas.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t how the economy typically worked over the last 35 years.&nbsp;Calculations made earlier this year by state economists in Oregon&nbsp;show&nbsp;that big cities tended to grow at rate similar to&nbsp;other areas of the country after a recession. Only the late 1990s were an exception. Until now.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Source: Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. http://oregoneconomicanalysis.com/2014/07/23/metro-size-and-growth-an-update/\" src=\"http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2014/11/Ore3.png\"><\/img><figcaption>(Source: Oregon Office of Economic Analysis)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Those diverging fortunes help explain why people in broad swaths of the country perceive that the recession, which ended officially in mid-2009, still hasn&rsquo;t <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AVS-Pre-election-2014-Topline-Final.pdf\">loosened its grip<\/a> on their lives. Rural areas without oil or gas reserves have on average only recovered one-fifth to one-quarter&nbsp;of the jobs they lost during the crisis, according to calculations by Joshua Lehner, an economist for the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In an ideal world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have jobs for everyone that wanted them&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;regardless of where they live.<\/p>\n<p>It may be that this&nbsp;geographic jobs gap is a permanent feature in an economy increasingly driven by brainpower and innovation, where clustering smart people in relatively small areas appears to boost labor productivity. That&rsquo;s certainly what the economists think at the Brookings Metropolitan Program, which conducted its&nbsp;breakdown of job growth at the request of The Washington Post.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Scale and density concentrate economic inputs like skilled people and R&amp;D, intensify interactions, allow for labor market pooling and matching, allow for access to shared infrastructure,&rdquo; said Mark Muro, the metro program&rsquo;s policy director. &ldquo;This a fact of economic life. Place, scale and density matter.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Or, says,&nbsp;Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the online real estate site Trulia, it could be that there&rsquo;s nothing new here, other than that some parts of the country are just correcting the excesses of the last housing bubble.&nbsp;&ldquo;We need to be further outside of this economic cycle before we can say whether there&rsquo;s been a permanent shift in the past few years,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In California, researchers are beginning to worry that the economy and the state budget depend too heavily on Silicon Valley. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine a cascade where tech growth slows, employees cash in fewer stock options and capital gains receipts fall, plunging the state back into the sort of budgetary trouble that plagued it throughout the 2000s.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly enough, government budget cuts may be one driver of the big metro/everyone else disparity. Smaller communities tend to have less diverse economies than major cities, Lehner said, and so when cuts force layoffs of teachers and civil servants, those smaller areas have fewer other jobs to cushion them. That&rsquo;s a factor in his state, Oregon, where Portland has gained back all its lost jobs, plus two percent, whilethe rest of the state&nbsp;is still four&nbsp;percent below its jobs peak.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2014/11/Ore2.png&w=1484\"><\/img><figcaption> (Source: Oregon Office of Economic Analysis) <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That brings up another&nbsp;concern about growth being concentrated in big metro areas: They tend to be more unequal and expensive places to live.

Palo Alto residents love to talk about the bidding wars on their blocks, with multimillion-dollar homes being bought entirely for cash. Home prices are up <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/portland-or/home-values/\">more than five&nbsp;percent<\/a> over the last year in Portland, Ore. Trulia reported Tuesday that homes are getting less affordable for the middle class, especially in high-income areas.<\/p>\n<p>When jobs are concentrated in pricier areas, workers often face a choice: Accept a more expensive life or drive longer to get to work.&nbsp;Many of them choose the commute&nbsp;&ndash; which means more traffic, on the 101 and elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Jim Tankersley is the editor of Storyline, where he explains complex public policies and illuminates their human impact.

And President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said in a speech last week that his finance minister, Rodolfo Marco, would soon travel to China to try to secure new loans.\nMr. Maduro\u2019s popularity has plummeted to 30%, polls show, as Venezuela\u2019s currency collapses and the government struggles with the world\u2019s highest inflation rate and widespread scarcity of basic goods. The country\u2019s woes threaten the future of what Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, the late President Hugo ChÃ¡vez , called 21st Century Socialism.\nAnalysts say Beijing\u2019s flexibility may buy Mr. Maduro more time.\nLast week the president used a $4 billion Chinese credit, traditionally earmarked by the Chinese government for infrastructure projects and held in off-budget funds, to increase reserves to $23.2 billion. China also recently lent $1.3 billion to help Argentina buoy falling reserves, giving President Cristina Kirchner , a close ally of Mr. Maduro, a cushion to help alleviate that country\u2019s cash crunch.\nBeijing\u2019s largess may appear irrational given economic policies in Venezuela and Argentina that do not appear sustainable, said Barbara Kotschwar, a scholar who tracks Chinese investment in Latin America at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Ms. Kotschwar said, \u201cthey are so invested in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry that they may have calculated that a political crisis would have a negative impact on their return on investment or on Venezuela\u2019s repayment of loans.\u201d\nVenezuela\u2019s oil revenues, which account for 96% of the country\u2019s dollar income, are down by 35% in the past month, Mr. Maduro said in a speech last week in which he tried to assure his countrymen that the government was taking steps to safeguard against the consequences of the drop in oil prices.\nVenezuela, hemorrhaging money through a Byzantine set of three official currency exchanges, was experiencing dollar shortages even with oil at $100 a barrel. On Friday, though, the country\u2019s average heavy crude oil price fell under $70 a barrel for the first time in four years.\nAs the oil exporter seen as most vulnerable to the commodity\u2019s slide, Venezuela has been pressing fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to take measures to rescue prices at the cartel\u2019s next meeting Thursday in Vienna.\nAmid the slump, China last month scrapped the requirement that Venezuela ship at least 330,000 barrels of oil a day as payment for its existing loans.\nThe reduced shipments of Venezuelan crude to China reflect the surplus in international oil markets as well as the Chinese economy\u2019s slower growth, but they also amount to a mutually beneficial arrangement.\nVenezuela can divert more of its oil to cash customers, instead of using it for debt repayment. China, meanwhile, can play the long game, helping stabilize the Venezuelan economy while keeping the door open to an important market for its oil-services, drilling, mining, appliances and construction companies. China\u2019s biggest investments here are in the vast Orinoco heavy-oil belt, where Beijing has pumped billions of dollars into a joint venture with state energy giant PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA.\n\u201cThe whole idea of China getting into Latin America is to secure their supply lines, and in the short term they are secure,\u201d said Russ Dallen, managing partner at brokerage Caracas Capital Markets. \u201cThey are patient.\u201d\nNews of the loosened Chinese loan terms bolstering Venezuelan international reserves\u2014down 21% from 2012\u2014sparked a rally last week in Venezuelan bonds, which are the highest yielding in the developing world because of the perceived risk.\nAnalysts at the risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a recent report that China\u2019s new terms will likely help Venezuela avoid a default next year. They also buy Mr. Maduro time to consider politically costly adjustments that economist say are necessary to plug a fiscal shortfall they estimate will reach 20% of gross domestic product in 2015. Those reforms include reducing a domestic gasoline subsidy that costs the state more than $12 billion a year and cutting back on overseas spending, including a program that provides cheap oil to more than a dozen Caribbean countries.\nVenezuela\u2019s benchmark sovereign bond maturing in 2027 rose on Monday to 56.41 cents on the dollar with a yield of 18.2%, compared with 53.7 cents at the start of last week. By far, the juiciest yields come from PdVSA bonds, which mature in 2017, offering just over a 28% yield, compared with 31.5% a week earlier.\nWrite to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com","title":"China Loosens Debt Terms for Venezuela","diffbotUri":"article|3|-1801449727","pageUrl":"http://t.co/UODBEeeXGJ","images":[{"title":" Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, left, shares a laugh with China's President Xi Jinping in July near a bust of late Venezuelan President Hugo ChÃ¡vez.

He\u2019ll be in China this month, visiting Beijing and other cities.\n\u201cEvery time I come back, my perception of China has changed,\u201d Slyngstad, who turned 52 today, said in an Oct. 29 interview in his fifth-floor office in Oslo. \u201cThere has been more and more of a question mark over what\u2019s the next step for that economy. The uncertainty among investors is partially due to the very simple fact that it\u2019s more difficult to know what\u2019s happening in that large economy than in any other.\u201d\nThe composition of the global economy, including the future of emerging markets such as Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, will be decided in China, Slyngstad says. Yet growth in China, which by some calculations is already bigger than the U.S. economy, is slowing and the lack of transparency is making it hard for investors to understand exactly why.\nBigger Quota\nSlyngstad, who last year visited Shenzhen, Hangzhou and the Shandong province, is looking for investments to channel billions of dollars in Norway\u2019s oil cash. He has been lobbying the Chinese government to allow the fund a bigger quota than the $1.5 billion it\u2019s permitted to place in Chinese A shares.\n\u201cThe reason why I spend some time going around there is because it\u2019s less of a homogenous economy than is widely perceived,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as a fund have a strong interest in China and still a strong belief in the importance of the development of that economy.\u201d\nRelated:\nThe fund can also invest in China through listed companies in Hong Kong. Its exposure to the country amounted to 2.7 percent of its stocks in the third quarter, up from 2.5 percent at the end 2013. Holdings include oil producer and explorer PetroChina Co. (601857) and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world\u2019s largest lender by assets.\nNorges Bank Investment Management, which runs the fund as part the central bank, owned 1.3 percent of global stocks at the end of last year. Norway\u2019s Finance Ministry has set the broad guidelines at 60 percent in equities, 35 percent in bonds and the rest in real estate.\nCredit Markets\nFiguring out how to invest in China is just one of many hurdles. Slyngstad said one of the main worries now is how monetary policy will affect his investment decisions. Continued turmoil in Europe and distortions in credit markets also cause concern. Old rules don\u2019t always apply as the very nature of the capital markets has changed, he said.\n\u201cA continuous lowering of interest rates in many countries and unwillingness of some countries to step up and move interest rates back again has actually in some way structurally moved the whole capital market interest away from the bond market and toward the currency market,\u201d Slyngstad said. The fund in June said it would expand its bond investing to include more currencies in an effort to increase returns.\nSlyngstad said the fund is now \u201cless invested in\u201d credit markets after excess liquidity distorted prices. He\u2019s adjusting the portfolio even after corporate bonds were the fund\u2019s best performing asset class in the third quarter.\nUnderestimating Ebola\n\u201cIt seems like spreads are coming in but it\u2019s a secondary effect of monetary policy that from our reading has increased the need for pondering,\u201d he said.\nSlyngstad is also watching how the Ebola crisis will unfold. \u201cIn general, the possibility of a pandemic is underestimated in the market,\u201d he said.\nAfter working as head of equities, Slyngstad became CEO of the fund at the beginning of 2008 and says his tenure has coincided with a \u201cfascinating period\u201d in financial markets.\nThe financial crisis -- during which the fund has bought up cheap securities everyone else was selling -- has challenged truths about investment management, monetary policy, the economy and the financial markets, he said. It has showed that the financial industry has the capacity to heal itself, with or without the help of regulators, according to Slyngstad.\nCreative Destruction\nThe power of the crisis could be called \u201cSchumpeterian creative destruction,\u201d said Slyngstad, who has studied German philosophy.\n\u201cCrisis within the financial sector also serves a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be careful about something that without a crisis looks stable, but may also turn stagnant.\u201d\nThe fund, which has been struggling to meet a 4 percent real-return target set by the government amid plunging interest rates, wants to broaden its investment universe to include infrastructure and private equity. While the infrastructure market currently isn\u2019t big enough at the global level and presents too much regulatory risk, the fund is preparing for the day the government gives it the green light.\nThe fund\u2019s annual real return has been 3.7 percent since 1998 and 4.1 percent in the past 10 years, according to its third quarter report. The nominal annual return over the past 10 years has been 6.4 percent.\nThe government has said it will first judge the fund\u2019s performance in real estate, where it\u2019s now boosting its investments toward 5 percent from 1.3 percent.\nA discussion on broadening the asset mix of the fund is coming \u201cno matter\u201d what, and a tipping point could be when it has reached 4 percent in real estate, Slyngstad said. The fund has so far snapped up properties on Times Square in New York, the Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris, London\u2019 Regent Street as well as San Francisco, Washington and Zurich among other cities.\n\u201cThat will be a natural touch point,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth for the real estate question, and for the real assets question.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Saleha Mohsin in Oslo at smohsin2@bloomberg.net; Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jonas Bergman at jbergman@bloomberg.net; Tasneem Hanfi Brogger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net Tasneem Hanfi Brogger","title":"Man Running World\u2019s Biggest Wealth Fund Tackles China Riddle","diffbotUri":"article|3|-1405637600","pageUrl":"http://t.co/gTJIFEnhkf","images":[{"title":" Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive officer of Norges Bank Investment Fund, stands on...

Her investors include Birchbox Inc. co-founders Hayley Barna and Katia Beauchamp; Cathie Black, former chairman and president of Hearst Magazines; David Bonderman, founding partner of TPG Capital; Katrina Lake, founder and CEO of Stitch Fix Inc.; Sheila Lirio Marcelo, founder, chairwoman and chief executive of Care.com; Alexis Maybank, founder of Gilt Groupe; and venture investors Brad Feld, founder of Foundry Group; and Josh Kopelman, partner at First Round Capital, and Jim Robinson, managing partner at RRE Ventures.\nPrior to FemaleFoundersFund, which she refers to as F Cubed, Ms. Duggal started and ran several companies. She co-founded Exclusively.In Inc., an e-commerce site based in India, in which Accel Partners and Tiger Global invested. Ms. Duggal said she left that startup before it was sold and her angel investors made a several-fold return on the investment.\nShe said that creating a formal fund, instead of being an independent angel investor, helps add structure to one\u2019s investments and bring more utility to entrepreneurs, such as through the large network of limited partners. Founders of the startups in which F Cubed invests will also receive a percentage of the carry in the fund, Ms. Duggal said.\nThe New York-based fund, which Ms. Duggal launched about a year ago, has already invested in 11 startups, mostly in the city. The firm writes checks of $50,000 to $150,000, she said, investing in rounds that are typically about $1 million in size. Ms. Duggal said she expects to reserve about half of her fund for follow-on investments, and to back roughly 20 to 25 startups in all. Many companies will be in the consumer sector, she said.\nF Cubed\u2019s portfolio includes Minibar, an alcohol delivery startup; Manicube Inc., which sends manicurists to offices; and Campus Job, which connects college students to part-time work. Some of these startups already have gone on to raise Series A rounds or are in the process of doing so, she said. Manicube, for example, pulled in a $5 million Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures.\nF Cubed co-invested with funds including Box Group, Homebrew, Harrison Metal, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Lowercase Capital, Greylock Partners, Great Oaks Venture Capital, Montage Ventures, SoftBank Capital and others.\nF Cubed is part of a wave of small venture funds, which some refer to as micro-VCs, that have recently popped up, raising less than $100 million.\nMs. Duggal said her hope with the first small fund is to create a brand and show that she can get into great startups. She hopes to raise a second fund down the line, possibly with more capital. At that time, she said, it would be possible to tap into institutional funding. Some institutional investors have mandates to invest in women fund managers, but first-time managers are usually not allowed under such mandates, she said.\nSeveral female-led venture firms have launched recently, including Aspect Ventures, started by Theresia Gouw and Jennifer Fonstad; and Cowboy Ventures, founded by Aileen Lee. In New York, Joanne Wilson, who invests out of her Gotham Gal Ventures, has backed dozens of women-founded startups. In China, VantagePoint Asia\u2019s Melissa Guzy and Citi Ventures\u2019 former head of Asia Wei Hopeman set up Arbor Ventures.\nJust 11% of all venture investors were women, according to a 2011 report from the National Venture Capital Association.\nThere are also a small but growing number of women-led startups.

[Recording date: October 6, 2014.] Russ: Now, your paper, \"The Rise and Fall of General Laws of Capitalism,\" is a critique of both, in general, the idea that there are general laws; but in particular, you are taking aim at Thomas Piketty's book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century. He was just recently a guest on EconTalk, discussing the book. And at the heart of your critique is a failure, you claim, on Piketty's part to take account in institutions. Explain what you mean. Guest: What I mean is that at some simple level, if you want to think about how economic outcomes, economic variables are determined, you know, if you go back to the way that we think about it, the way that we teach in our basic economics courses is that we talk about technology, supply side of the economy if you want to think about it that way. Preferences, the demand side. But there's always something that puts the two together. And in the basic, simple economic model, we have perfectly competitive markets or some sort of Cournot oligopoly. But of course reality is much more complicated. Government actions, actions by powerful groups in society through non-market means--bargaining, coercion, rent-seeking--all of those are in general part of this ensemble that put preferences and technology together to generate the outcomes that we care about. And broadly speaking we would refer to these as institutions, but [?] something else, but by institutions generally that's what we mean. And they have a life of their own. Not only do they matter; they also change. They change in response to the distribution of political power in society; they change in response to technology; they change in response to political demand coming from various quarters in society. And I think generally trying to formulate strong laws of how the capitalist system is going to evolve. Not that I am a big fan of the word 'capitalism,' by the way. Those laws are generally formulated for capitalism. Those sorts of laws generally ignore the role of institutions--both their impact but even more importantly their endogenous evolution. Because institutions make these sort of simplistic predictions much harder, because they mediate how these different sides of the market come together. Russ: Now, before we go any further, I want to defend Piketty. And then we'll get into the details. It's kind of a thrill for me--I don't get to defend him very often. So--I would argue that in his book he talks a reasonable amount about institutions. In fact, while I was reading his book, I knew that I was going to be interviewing you, and I came across a couple of quotes that suggest that he was at least sympathetic to your approach. I'm going to read one of them:\nIn order to understand the dynamics of wage inequality, we must introduce other factors, such as the institutions and rules that govern the operation of the labor market in each society. To an even greater extent than other markets, the labor market is not a mathematical abstraction whose workings are entirely determined by natural and immutable mechanisms and implacable technological forces: it is a social construct based on specific rules and compromises.\nAnd I would argue that you could have written that paragraph, more or less. Guest: Right. Russ: And he has a few others like that. It's not the only one. There are not a lot of them. But how would you defend your critique against that quote? Guest: No, I think, you know, what I should say, and we should be more explicit about this, is not that Thomas generally ignores all sorts of factors other than capital and labor. But that these are not an integral part of the main arguments of his theory, in the same way that they weren't part of the main argument of Karl Marx's theory. At some level you can read Marx as a formulation of many important institutional dimensions of society. But when it comes to it, at the end, Marx's predictions are very much derived by abstracting from the various different effects of the institutional factors. But in particular, if you take all of the statements that Thomas makes, which include what you have just read, or in other places he puts a lot of emphasis on minimum wages for example or some [?] taxes--you know, you would say, yeah, all right, of course there are; he's suitably cautious in these things. But at the end of the day, the major predictions, the major force of his approach, which is that it's going to be the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate that is going to determine both the capital share and inequality in society, and these are the major forces which we have to understand about the revival or stability of the capitalist system, I think that's where institutions make no appearance. And, whenever institutions are sort of mentioned, such as wealth taxes or sometimes in the quotes[?] almost social norms that regulate the pay of the super-managers, etc., they are very much an outside construct. They are not part of what is changing and what needs to be explained. And that's what I am sort of drawing, we are sort of drawing the parallel to Marx, where, again, all those, there is an important institutional element in Marx, in particular his view of the Communist economy is an institutional one at some level--there is going to be a change from the capitalist to the communist or socialist to the communist. But his understanding or his explanation of how the capitalist system works in some sense is largely determined by some fundamental economic and accumulation force. Russ: I totally agree with that. I think there's some thoughtful analysis along the way. But when it comes to the bottom line it gets sort of pushed away, or ignored, or unemphasized. I think that's part of the problem with the book. It's not my main problem with the book.\n7:33\nRuss: But let's continue. I want to start with Marx, because, as you do point out, Piketty's book is a, in some sense, there's certainly a wink if not a nod to Marx. In the title: the title of his book is Capital--In the Twenty-First Century. And Marx's book of course was called Das Kapital. So there is certainly a--and he writes a lot about Marx in the book--he certainly sees himself in that tradition, that grand tradition, not just focusing on capital but also in deriving general rules. So I thought it would be useful, certainly for me, and for our listeners, to hear: What were Marx's general rules? And what went wrong with them? Guest: Well, I mean I think Marx much more than Piketty had a very complex social theory, developed over many, many, many, many writings; and then put together in various different volumes--most importantly in Das Kapital, the first volume; and then posthumously, somewhat, some of them by Frederick Engels--Engels' and Marx's cooperation. So, anything you are going to say about Marx is going to be a simplification. But I think, doing that simplification, going along with that simplification--I would say that Marx had a conception which, in my opinion, and James Robinson's opinion, minimized [?] role. In two different ways. The first one is that his overall conception of how social, political, and economic outcomes were determined was a very materialistic one, in which, although in some of his works for example--most notably in the \"Eighteenth Brumaire\" he does talk about autonomous political factors--so the coup of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, etc.--at the end of the day he had a conception in which the base, the economic relations, determined everything else. So, though it is important, according to Marx to talk about political factors, those are very much shaped by the economic currents of the time and [?]. And, taking his cue from this overall framework, or historical materialism if you want to think of it or a simplified version, sort of, materialism, he did articulate several strong predictions or tendencies about how the capitalists work. In the paper, we emphasize three of those. One of them is the, sort of the general law of capitalist accumulation as he viewed it, which is about what's going to happen to real wages. See, here, Marx is a little less than fully specific. He does sometimes talk about real wages being [?] stagnant. But at all improvements in output and productivity go to capital, and sometimes the weaker form where, you know, the share of national income captured by labor declining over time, even if wages freeze from time to time. He does then talk about something else that's very well known, in Marxist economics: the general law of declining profits. And then later, he also talks about the general law of decreasing competition, which is, you know, the move toward monopoly capitalism--another one of the themes that post-Marxian economists have emphasized a lot. Russ: And those predictions didn't turn out so well. Why not? Guest: They did not. They did not. And I think, you know, the first one we know best. In fact Marx wasn't totally off target when he was writing. When he was writing was one of the most challenging things that people were aware, even if they did not have high quality data that we now have access to, is that, you know, there were a lot of things going on in the economy. The technological infrastructure of the economy was being totally revolutionized. And there were big monies being made by certain investors in corporations. But wages were stagnant or perhaps not doing so well for certain portions of the population. So out of this, Marx said, Look, labor is not going to benefit from all of these things, because this is all part of the nature of the capitalist. But, you know, that was happening in a given, particular, political, social, and technological context. The political and the social is actually very important, because when this was taking place, the balance of power in society was still very much a remnant of the old feudal time. Democracy was certainly sort of beginning to develop in Britain, with the First Reform Act, but was in a very, very embryonic form--was certainly not very active, and there wasn't representation in much of the rest of the Continent. And over time, so this balance of power started changing with greater democracy, greater franchise, greater representation, better organized labor, all sorts of regulations that changed how the pie would actually be divided. But even more importantly, the social and the political context determined the two most important factors shaping wages: human capital and technology. Together with these institutional, political institutional changes, came a whole revolutionary set of changes in the education. So, education ceased to be an elite activity, or the sons and daughters of the very prosperous, privileged part of the society-- Russ: Mostly the sons-- Guest: The sons, yes, that's right. Russ: At that time. Mostly the sons. Guest: Absolutely, absolutely, yes, that's what I should have said. Guest: And became basically available to the masses, although the whole sort of mass [?] movement in Europe and Britain did take a good part of the 19th century. And this was part of the super-rapid increase in the supply of skills during the 19th century, unprecedented relative to the past. Not that there weren't some very specialized skills. The British artisans were very skilled. There were pockets of highly skilled artisans and specialized workers in Continental Europe. But the whole work force became much more educated. And then, secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, for wages: the general environment, the institutional general environment, continued to support creation of better and better technologies and the scaling up of the employers that were willing to use that technology because they could outcompete their competitors, the incumbents in many cases, without very strong protection for these incumbents from the political powers. Big change, in some sense from the 18th century, for example. And with their ability to borrow, the financial markets, to patent and use and sell their innovations. So the whole sort of infrastructure of what we now view as the market economy got formed and developed in much of the 19th century. As this happened, the demand for labor increased; the demand for skilled labor increased. And all of these things kept pushing wages up. And in fact, somebody writing without so much reference to Marx, but just writing about trends in the second half of the 20th century, the most remarkable thing would have been the very steady increase in living standards over the last 100 years.\n16:26\nRuss: Correct. And I think--let me--I want to push against both Piketty and your analysis. It seems to me that overwhelmingly, that rise in the living standards is due to two factors. Three. Maybe two and a half. And then I'll let you add--and then I'm going to see is left for institutions. So, we have the technological change. Which in itself is endogenous. It's a bit of hand waving to suggest it just sort of happens. That technological change certainly, as it goes along, requires, for it to continue, the application of capital. And that capital accumulation, which leads to technological change, leads to enormous improvements in productivity. And then the question becomes, for the Marxists: Why doesn't capital retain all the profit that it could? And I would answer that the main reason it doesn't isn't institutional. It's merely competition. Now, that is competition among profit seekers--entrepreneurs, corporations, etc.--forces them to share the gains with consumers, and then in turn with workers. Competition to acquire both customers and workers. Now, I will accept the argument, and I'll let you flesh it out--unless you want to push it in a different direction--that institutions determine how that competition plays out. Certainly that's true. But I think that role of competition in forcing--that's the right word; I don't think it's the best word but it's the only one I've got--forcing capitalists to share that bounty of that higher productivity with the general public, is the story of 1850-2014, even in the middle of this recession. And I'm curious what you think. But I don't understand about Piketty, and we can talk about this later--is, capital to me seems to be a crucial ingredient in the standard of living of the masses; and I don't understand how wars, which lower the amount of capital, are therefore good for the rest of us, but even though they are bad for the top 1%. I think they are bad for all of us. Not just the fact that people die, but because it does destroy capital. But just on your argument: what's the role for institutions in my story? What am I missing? Guest: Okay. So, I think you've got it absolutely right. I am 100% agreeing with you. Which is that what happened from 1850 is that technology moved apace. Human capital improved. Technology and human capital together created more and more demand for labor, pushed up marginal product of labor. And because labor markets were increasingly quasi-competitive, let's say--and I wouldn't go to say as far as saying they were competitive-- Russ: I don't know what that word means. Right? Competitive. It doesn't-- Guest: Well, what it means is--I'm not saying that wages were equal to the value of marginal product of labor-- Russ: Of course. Guest: But they were scaling up with the value of marginal productivity. Russ: Yup. Guest: So these factors together explain why the share of labor essentially remained constant together with GDP (Gross Domestic Product), wages increased and in some places actually share of labor increased faster than GDP. But what I disagree with you is the counterfactual. You are making the statement conditional on the institutions, in particular labor market institutions supported by the political institutions as we saw in the United Kingdom and in parts of Continental Europe. But those labor market institutions, supported by the specific social and political institutions of that time, were actually the exception in human history. And if you think about how labor markets worked, in much of Continental Europe, before and at the time of the French Revolution, in the United Kingdom actually, in the 17th century, 16th century, it would have been very, very different. And for instance, take places in which there was labor coercion. At the time that this was happening, or, you know, shortly before then, you still had labor coercion in many different parts of the world. And in those parts of the world there were huge swings in the value of marginal product of labor. For example, you had sugar prices fluctuate a lot and improve and increase the value of marginal product of labor of slaves in Jamaica and Cuba and Haiti. That did not translate into increases in the wages of labor. Russ: Great point. Guest: [?] example. But that didn't [?] because this was not in the context of a market economy. They key thing, and that's the institution part and that's why I think it's very important when I say that the Marxist theory and Piketty's theory don't have a role, or don't have an organic role for institutions: I really mean the evolution of institutions also. The crucial part is that these institutional structures, what was going on the labor markets, the representation of labor, the Chartist Movement and then the Trade Unions in the United Kingdom that represented the labor's interest, developed together with these more competitive, quasi-competitive markets, and led to an equitable distribution of the gains from economic growth--those same gains would not have been distributed equitably if Europe still had the institutions of the 1700s or the 1600s.\n22:11\nRuss: Fair enough. And it's a great point. I do have a question though about modern improvements to the standard of living. I used to ask, when I would teach non-economists--law students or law professors or journalists or judges. I would ask them: Why is our standard of living in America higher than Mexico's? And I would often get the answer: Because we have a minimum wage and they don't. Yeah. Don't laugh. It's a common answer. And it's not a bad answer if you haven't thought about it a lot. And I would never laugh out loud, I want to say on the record, when I heard that. But the reason you laugh is that argument is very hard to sustain. There is not a lot of evidence for it. Guest: I don't mean to laugh--you know, I think if you want to explain why that certain types of workers in the United States have much lower wages than those workers in France, minimum wage is an excellent answer. Russ: Yes. That's correct. Guest: But I think, before you can get there you need to have a much greater institution parity. As you do have, with some important differences and distinctions between France and the United States. And that brings more, greater technological parity. But when you are comparing Mexico to the United States or Peru--you are [?] mistake-- Russ: Not going to work. Not going to work. Guest: Yeah. There are much more important first-order factors. Russ: Right. But the next argument you would hear is that we have unions and they don't. And I think that' a commonly held--let me make the argument more generally. When you ask, why was the 20th century so great in America overall despite a horrible depression, two world wars--lots of challenges? Why did it turn out so well? There are a lot of people who believe that it was the social legislation of the New Deal, the minimum wage, Social Security, certain bargaining laws for labor, Robinson-Patman, other types of innovations--I hope I had that right in terms of the timing--that forced capital to share the gains with labor. I just don't see that argument--empirically. I understand the argument, the idea behind it. In think empirically it's very hard to sustain that. Guest: Well, I disagree and I agree. I think my view is that, you know, think of it this way. So, I'm going to caricaturize my own view, but I think the view is [?]. You talked the competitive labor market. I think that competitive labor markets are actually a quite difficult thing. Nobody actually has an interest in a competitive labor market. Everybody would like to be a monopolist. Everybody would like to form coalitions with their friends and the people with whom they have some overlapping economic interest. And, with those coalitions, force for certain noncompetitive elements. So, at some point in human history you are going to find yourself close to the extreme of the slavery system that I just mentioned, where coercion is very strong. And even when coercion is not as strong there is huge imbalance of power because employers are monopsonistic; workers are in poverty or are being forced into poverty. For example, as in South Africa before the fall of apartheid. It's not just that you have coercion, which apartheid did exploit it. But also apartheid, as part of its existence, reorganized the entire labor force, pushed workers into these bantustans where they could not survive on agricultural, so that they would become cheaper labor for mines or for other white-controlled employers. In other periods, you are going to have, as you have had, getting a little weaker, but in parts of Continental Europe where unions are going to be so strong and employers are going to be so weak; so now you are going to have a situation and a wedge [?wage?]--unions are going to push for excessively high wages for their own members at the expense of other workers and at the expense of capital innovation in the economy. So, therefore, I cannot answer the question as to whether unions are good for the functioning of the economy or not. It really depends on what side of this tradeoff we are, or what side of this sort of balance we are. So if we are on the side of the balance where we were at the end of the 18th century, then I think it was important for the labor movement to play an important role, to balance that out. If you are where you were in Portugal, for example, in the end of the 1990s, perhaps it is good for unions to become sort of less able to push for innovation curtailing and business sort of killing high wages. So it's really the balance of where you are. So, I think--do I believe that it was important for Britain to have its labor movement become more well organized, more powerful, in the mid-19th century? Yes. Do I think that it was important for the United States for labor to become a little bit organized--it never became as organized, but at the beginning of the 20th century, so that some of the worst abuses, especially in terms of safety and child labor and other things that were going on in some marginal parts of the labor market, but not unimportant parts of the labor market in the United States? I think those were important. But I also don't think that you can generalize this to say that everywhere and under all circumstances you should push for stronger unions. Nor do I believe that the minimum wage or the Social Security legislation per se were that important for understanding the development of wages, development of living conditions in the United States--as you have already hinted at.\n28:37\nRuss: So, one of the reasons I like talking to you is that you make me think about these things. You challenge my preconceptions. I'm going to give you one more, and then we'll move on. Because I find this extremely interesting. And I take your point about balance. But here's my puzzle. I have a cleaning woman who comes to my house with a crew of three people once a week. She speaks pretty good English. The three people she brings, they don't speak English very well. They don't have a union. Their bargaining power seems to me very limited in the way that bargaining power is talked about as an important art of labor market outcomes. They make a little over $23, $24 an hour--which is about, roughly three times the Federal minimum wage--I don't know what the state minimum wage is. Guest: These ladies--ladies do make? Russ: Yeah. Each one. Guest: Wow. Very good. Wow, great. Russ: Well, it's hard to clean a house; it's hard to show up every time, every week on time; it's not pleasant work particularly; but if you do it well and you do it diligently, you make--you don't get any benefits; it's not great; it's hard to work 2000 hours a year doing it; you have travel time between things. It's not great. But their kids can go to college, actually in the United States, which is unbelievable; it's hard for them to get into more expensive ones sometimes or to be able to afford them. But they have a very different life here than they have in the countries that they came from. And the question I always as is: Why do I pay them three times the minimum wage? And it's not because I'm a nice guy. I wish it were. I like to think I'm a nice guy. But I pay them three times the minimum wage because if I don't, they don't come to my house. They have better alternatives. So, to me, competition, all this stuff about bargaining power and institutions, I don't see why it's so relevant. It seems to me that the technology--I'm going to come back to my original point: The supply and demand thing kind of powers through a lot of things. Guest: Okay. So, I think in your labor market, it might turn out that way, that $23 an hour, there's so many employers that are individually willing to hire these labors, that competition is able to take care of it. I think in many parts of the United States, despite the fact that the United States is as close as one gets to that, you know, peak of the balance that I just described, I would worry that the head lady will charge you $100 an hour, and then-- Russ: I'm sure she takes a disproportionate share. I don't think she divides it equally. Guest: And then will give each one of the other ladies $6. Russ: That could be. By the way, she drives a nicer car than I do. Guest: And that's because they are afraid that if they object to that, they are illegal or they have some other reasons to be afraid, and she is going to either drop them entirely or she is going to complain about them to the authorities. So they are in a very, very unequal, difficult bargaining position. And that the $100 that you are spending actually gets captured by the intermediary. And in fact, if there was better safety laws, perhaps these ladies would be compensated for doing some of the difficult job; or if there was, miraculously a better system in which people could not be taken advantage of in that way, their wages would be closer to the true value of their marginal product and as a result they will work even harder and we will have a more efficient and even a more liquid market. You know, one could tell stories. I don't know how the labor market in your area for cleaning ladies works. But I think the issue is that there are many pockets, even in as modern an economy as the United States which still in this day and age we are very [?] these issues. Still there are unequal labor relations. And you go to, you know, [?], the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, where migrant workers, who are paid so much better than they would have been paid had they stayed in Bangladesh or Pakistan or the Philippines, still are highly abused. And you can always say: Well, you know, labor demand, technology are going to take care of it. But it's a very slow process; and sometimes it doesn't because of the regulations, political power. Money is, all of them are on the side of the wealthy sheiks and princes in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. So, you know, it's a very, very unequal sort of fight, or unequal economic struggle between the migrant workers and their wealthy, powerful employers. Russ: I suspect that the labor market for cleaning people in the Boston area is very similar. But I take your point, especially with respect to how they are compensated within the group. I don't know. I may try to find out. Let's move on to Piketty. Guest: Let me know if you do. Russ: I will.\n33:31\nRuss:Let's move on to Piketty. So, Piketty has some general claims, and you talk about some of them in the paper that are a little bit on the technical side and don't lend themselves very well to audio. So, I'm going to leave those out. I'm going to focus on the big one. So, his biggest claim, the one that is the centerpiece of the book, is what he calls the central contradiction of capitalism: which is that the rate of return on capital, which he calls r, is going to almost always, or often is going to be greater than g which is the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and therefore holders of capital will see their well-being rise at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. And therefore inequality will grow inexorably. So, is that a fair summary, do you think, of his work? Guest: I think it's a very fair summary. Russ: So what's wrong with it? He treats it often as if it's just a mathematical truth. What's wrong with it? Guest: Well, I think there are several things wrong with it. I will classify them into four things that are wrong. First one is that the fundamental contradiction of capitalism is actually something that's implied by economic efficiency. So, in fact I think calling it a central contradiction of capitalism does create a little bit of a smoke-and-mirrors sort of thing. I'll come to that. Second, that to see this as an inexorable producer of inequality is at least theoretically--and I'll come back to the empirical part--wrong because r, the interest rate could be greater than g and that might still be consistent with stable inequality, decreasing inequality, lower inequality. Third, in focusing on r minus g in my opinion you are leaving out all of the more important determinants of inequality, all the institutional ones that we already talked about or those that come from other aspects of institutions[?] such as social mobility, for example, which I think is central. And then fourth, empirically, r - g doesn't do such a great job in explaining inequality or equality trend. So, those are the four things. Should I run through them? Russ: Yeah, let's go. Go for it. Guest: So, first of all, r - g actually, you know--this is a small point, but let me start with it. And this is a technical point but I think it's an important one. In economics, in growth theory, we call economies that do not satisfy r > g 'dynamically inefficient' economies. Because there is something fundamentally distorted about them. And in particular, if r were ever less or equal to g, less than g, let's take less than g, then you could actually make everybody better off in the economy without making anybody else worse. And that fundamentally the problem is that-- Russ: How? Guest: if r is less than g, that means that you are not properly compensating people for saving, which is an important economic activity; and as a result the economy generates too much capital. So, r minus g is a situation in which the economy has excessive amounts of capital. And it would be better for everybody else if it actually consumed some of that capital. And so, dynamic efficiency, what we sort of impose or expect the market economy to generate under fairly weak conditions, immediately leads to r > g. So, rather than being a sort of a newly discovered fundamental fault line of the market economy or the capitalism economy, r - g is exactly what market economy should generate. And generally does generate; although there are periods in which economies do go into dynamically inefficient periods.\n37:57\nRuss: Okay. So then--I'm going to take you off track for a minute; we may come back to the other three. But if it's actually a good sign for productivity and for the size of the pie, which is what dynamic efficiency is getting at, that phrase: if it's good for the growth or size of the pie, that r is greater than g, doesn't that mean that people who hold capital will see their nest egg, their savings, growing at a very high rate? And I'm just a poor wage earner; I'm just growing at a rate g if I'm lucky. I'm getting Piketty's story: international growth averages--sometimes it's higher, but in the developed countries it's usually between 2 and 3%. That includes population growth. So, productivity growth is 1-2%. And so that's the best I can hope for as a worker: I get a little booster throughout my life, but somebody who inherits money, they're getting r, so they are growing at a bigger rate, 5%, 7%. Doesn't that mean that the distance between the wage earner and the holder of capital is going to grow and grow and grow and over generations get even worse? Guest: So that's exactly my second point. So, the first one was that r - g is, it actually should be positive; that's quite basic economic theory we teach to all our students. And the second point is that r - g being positive doesn't actually imply increasing inequality. Yes, you're right--Thomas is right; and Thomas of course knows all of these things and in parts of the book he suitably caveats them. But let's take the most extreme version of the Pikettist position rather than Piketty's position, which would be: Yes, r - g is positive; that means that capital earners are going to have much, much, much, much higher, faster rates of growth of their wealth than workers. Well, that doesn't follow. That doesn't follow for several reasons. First of all, it's the case that not everybody is a capital owner all of the time. So, many people are saving for life-cycle reasons, or across generations they are saving to pass on to their kids, who are going to have lower earning potential. And if that's the case, you are not going to have that the translation--you are not going to have a direct translation of the rate of return on capital to the wealth of the capital owner's [?]. Russ: Plus-- Guest: More general point is that social mobility breaks this link between return to capital and where the capital owners are going to be. Social mobility here, I'm taking it a little bit broader than what we normally mean, which is that by social mobility we normally mean social intergenerational mobility. And we have quite a bit of that in the [?] economy. But here, I actually mean even more than that the fact that in your 40s you are going to be a very high earner; and then in your 60s you are going to live off the savings that you accumulated during your working. So all of those together imply that the link between, the gap between r and g and inexorably rising wealth inequality is tenuous at best. Russ: Let me extend your point, which is something we didn't talk about when I discussed this with Piketty. Which is, of course everyday people own stock as well. They have access to r through mutual funds; because probably the most--many of my guests changed the world in many kinds of ways. But I interviewed Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, and what he did is he democratized the access to capital through Vanguard's indexed mutual funds. It's an incredible revolution, really. Now it's true that not every single worker has access to it, but many, many do. And certainly more than, say, 50 years ago. And that's a wonderful thing. And Piketty ignores that. Of course, the other thing he ignores is that, as Bogle would point out, if you take what's called a buy-and-hold strategy and you buy a broad-based mutual fund, whether it's Vanguard's or somebody else's, you will do very well. You will earn the so-called market rate of return--pre-tax, of course. And you have to pay taxes on it--something Piketty often ignores. But pre-tax, you can earn that rate. Very few people's portfolios grow at that rate. For one reason, they diversify: they buy other things that are safer. Because there's risk in r, which is also often ignored. And secondly, they make mistakes. They get over-enthusiastic about return. They try to time the market. They waste a lot of money in fees. And we see the empirical evidence of this is overwhelming. You don't[?] have to do a study. You just have to look at what happens to rich people over time. They don't stay so rich. Not just they themselves, but their families [?] this over time, over generations. Guest: I think that second important, that's the important point, the second one you made, because I think Thomas is actually quite aware of that point. But he has a comeback to that, which is he would say--he doesn't emphasize this in the book although he doesn't articulate the criticism but he does respond to it at some level. He says: Capital income is very unequally held. So, capital is very unequally held. So, capital income, you know, yes, sure, the average worker does hold some stocks, true, Charles Schwab or Vanguard. But you know, it's very, very-- Russ: It's a small amount. And it's not a hedge fund; you can't get the return that hedge funds get. Of course many hedge funds go broke. Guest: But even if they were to get the same return-- Russ: Start with a smaller amount-- Guest: 99% would hold, you know, 50%, 60% of the capital stock, according to this view, and then the top 1% would hold 40% and then of course the return on capital would disproportionately go to the top 1%. But the key thing is that: Who is in that top 1%? If you look at who is in that top 1%, that changes over time. The people who are in the top 1% today, many, a large fraction of them were not in this top 1% 30 years ago. Russ: Yeah. His answer to that--I don't fully understand. I pointed that out to him. But his answer is: At the rate--when he points out that the rate of growth of the top 1% is growing, I say it's not the same people. And he still says, oh but this can't go on forever; eventually, even if the people are continually leapfrogging each other, I think he views it as somehow alarming that at some point in the future, the people, whoever they are, in the top 1%, will have too much political and economic power. Guest: Well, that's a different point. And we'll come back to that. And then I'll want to come back also to this issue--there is a little sleight of hand there, which is--again, I'm not sure whether I'm reading all of Thomas's statements accurately, but if my reading is accurate, he's saying: Look, capital is so important, capital is [?], capital is going to be the driver. But actually he's quite well aware, and his data from both the United States and France quite clearly show that the increase in inequality is not a capital phenomenon. It's a labor income phenomenon. So therefore what he's saying is that, sure it might be that's it's been labor income that's been driving the increase in inequality over the last 50 years, to an extent that we had not seen in the beginning of the 20th century, in the first half of the 20th century, or the 19th century. But it remains the case that in the future it will be capital that dominates. Russ: Great summary. Guest: We don't have any evidence for that. Russ: Yeah. That's a great point. I think that's exactly what's right or wrong about his analysis. With the caveat, as my listeners know, that I think the rise in labor inequality is grossly overstated because of demographic changes in the United States, because the analysis is households, not individuals; and there's been big changes in household formation and destruction because of divorce and delay-to-marriage date. And as a result when we see that trend it overstates the actual trend. But let's put that to the side, because that's a statistical issue.\n46:44\nRuss: Let me get to a different point about the labor-income inequality. You can come back, make whatever the point you were going to make. I apologize. Guest: Okay. Yeah. Sure. You get to run this. You can take it wherever you want. Russ: I try not to take too much advantage of it. But you're very polite. You fault him for just \"presenting the data.\" I think one of the reasons his book has been so successful-- Guest: Well, that's the point I want to make, actually. That's my fourth point. Russ: Yeah. Make that point. Because on the surface, it seems like a selling point. All he does, it's just the facts, ma'am, just the facts. Guest: Well, let's come back to that. Can I--Let me cover the third one very briefly-- Russ: Yeah, go ahead-- Guest: and then we can come to the fourth one, which is essentially the one that you're making. The third one is that even if you ignore the first two points that I made or if you take account of them but think they're not of course the end of the world for this point of view--but this point of view ignores the fact that there are so many other important determinants of inequality than r - g. And we try to, in the paper we try to illustrate that for example with the trends in inequality in Sweden and South Africa. And you can see quite easily there are huge changes in inequality in both of the countries over the 20th century. But none of it is related to r - g. None of it is related to wars or destruction of capital. So, they, are all deeply institutional. They are related to the formation of the social welfare state in Sweden. They are related to the nature of the apartheid regime which held black wages down but redistributed them among whites; and then the collapse of the apartheid regime, and so on. So that's a third one, which is that the focus on r - g might sort of involve throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The really interesting stuff left out. And then the fourth one is exactly the one that you made, which is: What does the data show? So, Thomas is doing a fantastic job of digging new data that is quite informative on a set of questions about economic [?] inequality. Together with Emanuel Saez and Tony Atkinson and a number of other researchers, he's been at the forefront of using tax returns data to shed new light on age old questions of inequality among economists and labor economists. But the literature has always been a very empirical literature. Which is that if you make a claim, then you look at the data not just in terms of the statistics, but you also provide the \"relevant correlations\" or the regressions--first starting with ordinary least squares regressions that sort of document what the correlations are. And then you worry about causality--what causes it? Is it really x causing y, or z causing x and y, or y causing x? So somehow surprisingly at some level, Thomas never does that. He sort of lays out the data. And he says, here are really interesting patterns. And I go with him totally--these are really interesting patterns. And he gets full credit for bringing those patterns to the attention of millions. But on the other hand, he then takes the next step, and he says, Well, here are the patterns and these are explained by r - g being positive and here they are explained by the World Wars, and here they are. But how do we know that? Russ: Had do you know? Guest: Have we done the cross-country correlation? Over-time correlation? Across households correlations? Or regressions? He never takes that step. And then, when you actually look at the data--for example, you do a very, very simple sort of correlational analysis and you say: Well, is it really true that in years or 5-year periods or decades during which r is greater than g, inequality increases? No. The data don't show that. So the data are quite clear that there doesn't seem to be a big correlation out there between r - g and inequality, top income share, or anything like that.\n51:06\nRuss: So, I want to come back to that. Because I think that's the central thing--it's a beautiful point. It's really what economics is all about: it's about complexity, and the challenges of trying to parse out causation. Which I think we have mixed success at. But before I do that, I just want to let you make one more comment about something else you note in the paper. Which is: You fault him for focusing on the top 1%. What's wrong with that? Isn't that important? What's your critique there? Guest: Oh, it's absolutely important; absolutely, absolutely important. But it's one of the many important things. Again, let me give the example of South Africa. South Africa is a case study in inequality. One of the most unequal countries in the world. It's been so for quite a while. But it's not about the top 1%. It's about blacks versus the rest of society. Or whites versus blacks and coloreds throughout the apartheid period. This is just like a beautiful political economy analysis; every aspect of South African society, from marriage to education, from labor market laws to political representation, they are all designed in order to keep blacks relatively poor economically, and make sure that whites get the lion's share of economic gain. But you are not going to see that with the top 1%. In fact, top 1% share declines throughout the period of the apartheid. So, if you just looked at the top 1% you'd say, well, this economy is doing well; the elite must be getting weaker over time. Russ: Part of that is a sort of a presumed focus on a zero-sum game. Which I think is--as you of course point out, and as he would point out: he understands it's not a 0-sum game. But when you talk about shares relentlessly you tend to get people's minds focused on it being a 0-sum game. And therefore you tend to miss some things. Guest: But I think there is one aspect in which I think Thomas is right, Thomas is right. As well as things like poverty--what's the bottom 10%, how the bottom 10% is doing. How is the median doing? The Gini coefficient, which Thomas hates but which is still a useful diagnostic. As well as all of those, we should look at the top 1%, both because of the many different dimensions of inequality that we should keep track of[?]. But there is an important element about top 1%. It might sort of ring alarm bells in our mind, which is that it is possibly, probably--probably--related to how dominant the economic elite in society are. So, if you have that the share of the top 1% is increasing very rapidly, it is right for us to worry about, as social scientists and for journalists to worry about in their investigative journalism role, about whether the society is being increasingly dominated politically, socially, and economically by a very small fraction of the population. So for example if the top 1% is becoming very, very rich at the same time as somehow--[?] sounds has some eerie relevance to the United States--if somehow money becomes more and more dominant in politics. That, you might actually worry about it, and you might say, Well, you know, top 1%'s share increased from 15% to 30%, and around that time, a lot of that money started flowing into politics, and then people like Sheldon Adelson are able to sort of finance particular candidates and then with very clear economic agendas about how gambling should be treated, etc.--well, that could be something quite problematic for the society. It could be quite dangerous for society. So we should actually think about this. But as my explanation here suggests, that we should really worry about the political and institutional aspects of it. Not just look at what's going on in the tax returns, but really think about the resilience of the institutions--which are the fault lines of the institutions?\n56:22\nRuss: Well, when you talked earlier--we're almost out of time; I want to bring us back to the beginning of your conversation, and I'll let you close us out. But you talked earlier, you said it's ironic--you didn't say it was ironic, but I was thinking it was ironic--that Marx was writing at a time when wages were stagnant; so we saw that he presumed that tomorrow was going to be like today, which is like yesterday; and therefore, there was going to be this perpetual stagnation. And he of course was writing this on the verge, on the cusp of the greatest leap in individual living standards that human history has ever seen. Kind of ironic. I remember being, in graduate school in the 1970s when very wise people whose names I won't mention explained how Microsoft--excuse me, IBM; I'm two generations ahead, one generation ahead--how IBM is a threat because they have a monopoly. This was a very long-running Department of Justice case, that pretty much, by the time it finished, IBM was almost irrelevant in the markets that were being discussed. And then we were told that Microsoft was a monopoly, and of course that also was a long-running case that turned out by the time it was done to be totally irrelevant. And you wonder whether people who make these grand pronouncements are doing so right at the time when reality and other market forces, other factors that are not observed-- Guest: It's called mean reversion, or Galton's Fallacy. Russ: Yeah, that's--thank you for giving it a little bit of an air of sophistication. But, having said all that, you, I know, are worried about inequality. I'm not, so much. I am worried about the political part; I am worried about the financial sector directing resources to itself. I think there is some inequality that's very bad. But I'm much more worried about opportunity. I'm much more worried about anti-poverty, and I'm much less worried about people who get really rich providing things that make a lot of people happy. So, tell me where you stand on this issue. Do you think-- Guest: Well, I think my view is not actually that different. But I think probably the emphasis is a little different. So, I think it's very useful to distinguish three roles[?rules?] of inequality. Or, three sorts of judgments that one can, and should, have about inequality. One is, holding everything else equal, how bad is it that the allocation of resources in the economy is more unequal? So, do a thought experiment; we hold everything else the same, but then we take a little bit of money from everybody below the 90% percentile and again give those money to the people above the 90% percentile. What is our economic judgment? Well, I think most people would be: That's not a good a good thing. You'll have some egalitarian judgments and so on. And you might have a social welfare function, diminishing returns in it, that once somebody has a lot already you don't want them to get more. Etc. But in general of course in reality not everything else is held the same. When you increase inequality you also encourage certain types of activities more, certain types of activities less. So I think we have to take all of these things into account. And I think it's a complex decision. And probably many people would be a little bit against inequality in this dimension. Some of them would be very against. But we have to find a way of aggregating these preferences. The second dimension I think is much more important; and you sort of somehow separated that but I think it's not as separable. Which is: equality of opportunity. I think most of us would be very troubled by an economic and political system where if you are born into a rich family you go to such schools and form such networks and get such a leg up in life that you are always going to be the boss. You are always going to have the most privileged position in life, even if you are not talented. Even if you haven't worked hard. Even if you haven't done anything. Just because you are born in the right family. And I think sort of the view that many people have is that as we make inequality greater, we also make this equality of opportunity harder to achieve. And I think there is some truth to that. For example, if you look in a world in which there are credit market constraints, then, you know, you can have easily a situation--this is I think the truth, reality in many developing countries--poor people cannot afford to go to school. And for people who live in neighborhoods that don't have schools, villages or poor neighborhoods, or they don't have high quality schools. And as a result, social mobility, equality of opportunity very strongly suffers. And in a situation like that, if you do indeed want social mobility, if you do indeed want equality of opportunity, then it might be one of the important levers to actually try to do something about inequality. But, if that's the case--now it's a parenthetical comment--who cares about top 1% inequality? Are we going to make equality of opportunity for blacks in our inner cities who are clearly suffering from this, for Hispanics, for poor people in the least educated socially economically most disadvantaged part of the United States if we take some money from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and give it to millionaires, so the top 1% declines? Of course that's totally irrelevant. The right thing to focus on is really poverty; it's really opportunities available to people at the bottom of the income distribution. And top 1% share is quite irrelevant. Russ: Well, it's ironic, because Bill Gates--that seems to be my word of this episode; I apologize for overusing it--but it is ironic that in your example, you mention Bill Gates. Bill Gates is desperately trying to improve the schooling system. I don't think he's very good at it, but he would love to see smaller inequality by boosting the bottom, as would I think almost everyone in the world. It's a great idea. We need a better school system. But that has nothing to do with the amount of capital that the rich hold or the power that they have. Guest: Right. And then the third element--and then I think you agree on this also but perhaps you might think about it as a little bit more separable than income inequality, is political inequality. I think many people, again perhaps not everybody, but I think an overwhelming majority of Americans would think that a system in which only a handful of people have political voice and the rest of us are like sheep is not a good system. One man, one vote, in reality, our politicians[?] are accountable and representative to all of us. I think that's the sort of system that we want. There is a concern, and I think it's a real concern, that as the rich become richer and richer, unless there are the right sort of institutional checks--competitive elections, open political system, the right sort of punishments and social norms against political corruption and political backroom deals--I think there's a real danger that the very, very rich might become politically so dominant that they can start tilting the system to their favor. And we in the United States, we are seeing some of that. So I think that last element is the one that I already mentioned. That's the one where the top 1% is important and we have to watch out for it. But that's a deeply institutional political economy channel. Russ: Yeah, I totally agree. Where we might disagree is where I want to see that improve is by limiting the power of government. And the people who tend to be worried about inequality often want to increase the power of government. And I see that as a hopeless strategy. The idea that we can make government more powerful so we can reduce inequality to me is, to be honest, a little bit naive. Guest: Well, I think it's--you know, again, I think it depends on the specific historical context that we are in. So, you are certainly right: if you are thinking about exploitation--again, let me go to an extreme case like the apartheid state or the slave plantation or the feudal system--government power is the main method of the wealthy and the powerful to exploit and extract from the rest of us. But if you are thinking of the Gilded Age, the end of the--so, the age of the robber barons--then we have a system there where these trusts are so powerful economically and are so able to use the legal system that they crush any opposition. They are able to sort of maintain their monopolies at the expense of creating greater entry, greater variety, lower prices for the consumers. So in that case what you need to do is, you need to do standard antitrust regulation. But to be able to do the antitrust regulation, you need the government to become stronger. Which is exactly what the Progressives actually achieved during that period. I think the biggest achievement of the Progressives was the political reform that made the Senate more accountable. But also the whole sort of antitrust apparatus--that, I think is very important why Marx's third prediction about increasing concentration didn't pan out. Russ: I guess I'm a little more skeptical than you are antitrust legislation does what economists thinks it does or want it to do. Guest: Oh, I mean, I am totally willing to go along with you that antitrust regulation often does get misused. And there are many distortions. But again in some extreme situations where the economy is becoming [?] monopolized, I think it certainly is very important, the way that society itself will monitor how economic power is [?]\n1:05:23\nRuss: Well, we're over time. Why don't you close by talking about Piketty's book generally? Do you think it's an important book? Guest: Absolutely. How could anybody say that it's not an important book when you look at the impact it has had? I don't know how many copies it has sold, but you know, it must be in the millions. And it has transformed the debate; it has opened new debates. I think it's fantastic. I mean, it is true that it sort of became unusually successful partly because it did tap into a deep angst that people were already having about some of these issues; and it is building on decades of research in labor economics on inequality that many people were showing these striking inequality trends that existed in the United States that contrasted with some countries in Continental Europe, for example. The contrast between the United States and Scandinavia and France. And he built on all of this, and advanced that debate in many ways, and made lots of people interested in that debate. So there's a lot of things for us economists to sort of write more about. And that's the spirit in which James and I have written our piece--like the really interesting hypotheses that he had, we have to respond to it. And I think all of those are a great service and we should be all grateful to Thomas. What he's trying to do is a difficult one, and I think that probably is a balance that everybody has to sort of think about what's the optimal balance. He--what many economists or social scientists, especially economists do, is that, you know, we write academic papers to advance new ideas. And then we write popular pieces to sort of popularize those ideas, or introduce those ideas to a broader public or policy-makers, etc. So, Thomas tried to do both in the same volume. And I think there is a tension in there; and I think it's not clear what part of it is a scientific, academic statement about comparative statics or the effect of x on y empirically, and what part of it is an appeal to his readers, his natural readers, that: I really think there is something deeply unfair about this and I really think it's x that's important even if the data is not there. I think those sort of statements are also fine, but when the two are mixed sometimes I think it's not as easy to parse what is what. And that's the spirit in which the institutions are mentioned. Yes, minimum wage is important, the wealth tax is important; but if you look at his theoretical model, they are not at the center of it, and that's what I was trying to say at the beginning. So that's a good point to end it.","discussion":{"title":"Daron Acemoglu on Inequality, Institutions, and Piketty","numPosts":24,"diffbotUri":"discussion|3|-1116548029","pageUrl":"http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/11/daron_acemoglu.html","posts":[{"id":0,"author":"giuseppe Paleologo","parentId":0,"text":"One elementary observation about this podcast (and the previous one with Acemoglu): one may disagree with Acemoglu or not, but his attitude toward inquiry and his methodological openness are admirable, as well as his urbanity.

It's a labor income phenomenon\u2026So therefore what he's saying is that, sure it might be that it's been labor income that's been driving the increase in inequality over the last 50 years...But it remains the case that in the future it will be capital that dominates.\u201dNow I think I can see Acemoglu\u2019s point. He agrees there is inequality. He notes that in Piketty\u2019s data it is due to differences in occupational income. He just does not think the income differences necessarily imply a problem. If those differences are due to the influence of a coercive-institution, he thinks that understanding and addressing the institution is a better approach than trying to reduce the inequality through other means. \n@16:00 Russ Roberts said, \u201cThat technological change certainly, as it goes along, requires, for it to continue, the application of capital.

Well, that doesn't follow.\u201dAcemoglu explains this is because capital ownership changes over time, social mobility exists, and savings dissipate when people stop working. I would like to add that marginal returns diminish as capital accumulates. \nCapital requires maintenance. The more you acquire, the more it costs to maintain it. Thus, at some point, acquiring more capital paradoxically makes you less wealthy. The top one percent should be pitied, not envied. They are enormously above the \u201cgolden rule level of capital accumulation\u201d and even beyond the point where their marginal returns are entirely negative. The only reason they \u201cappear\u201d to maintain that much capital is because they are NOT maintaining that much capital. They have farmed it out to enormous numbers of other people\u2014who theoretically still have positive marginal returns on capital\u2014through exchange markets like the stock market. In the event that the capital owners ever withdraw out of those markets, however, they are exposed to the full, mammoth weight of their capital\u2019s depreciation. They have to consume that capital, and fast, or else it will consume itself. And it makes almost no difference if it was earned through sweat equity, a winning lottery number, an inheritance, or capital gains. Depreciation, the steady march towards entropy, is a physical law of the universe. It is up there with gravity.

It's a labor income phenomenon&hellip;So therefore what he's saying is that, sure it might be that it's been labor income that's been driving the increase in inequality over the last 50 years...But it remains the case that in the future it will be capital that dominates.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>\n<p>Now I think I can see Acemoglu&rsquo;s point. He agrees there is inequality. He notes that in Piketty&rsquo;s data it is due to differences in occupational income. He just does not think the income differences necessarily imply a problem. If those differences are due to the influence of a coercive-institution, he thinks that understanding and addressing the institution is a better approach than trying to reduce the inequality through other means.<\/p>\n<blockquote>@16:00 Russ Roberts said, &ldquo;That technological change certainly, as it goes along, requires, for it to continue, the application of capital. And that capital accumulation, which leads to technological change, leads to enormous improvements in productivity.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>\n<p>Based on what I learned from last week&rsquo;s podcast, I don&rsquo;t think capital accumulation leads to technological change. <\/p>\n<blockquote>@ 37:57 Dr. Acemoglu says, &rdquo;Let's take the most extreme version of the Pikettist position rather than Piketty's position, which would be: Yes, r - g is positive; that means that capital earners are going to have much, much, much, much higher, faster rates of growth of their wealth than workers. Well, that doesn't follow.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>\n<p>Acemoglu explains this is because capital ownership changes over time, social mobility exists, and savings dissipate when people stop working. I would like to add that marginal returns diminish as capital accumulates. <\/p>\n<p>Capital requires maintenance. The more you acquire, the more it costs to maintain it. Thus, at some point, acquiring more capital paradoxically makes you less wealthy. The top one percent should be pitied, not envied. They are enormously above the &ldquo;golden rule level of capital accumulation&rdquo; and even beyond the point where their marginal returns are entirely negative. The only reason they &ldquo;appear&rdquo; to maintain that much capital is because they are NOT maintaining that much capital. They have farmed it out to enormous numbers of other people&mdash;who theoretically still have positive marginal returns on capital&mdash;through exchange markets like the stock market. In the event that the capital owners ever withdraw out of those markets, however, they are exposed to the full, mammoth weight of their capital&rsquo;s depreciation. They have to consume that capital, and fast, or else it will consume itself. And it makes almost no difference if it was earned through sweat equity, a winning lottery number, an inheritance, or capital gains. Depreciation, the steady march towards entropy, is a physical law of the universe. It is up there with gravity. Piketty is ignoring something really, really fundamental in nature.<\/p>\n<p>[Comment edited by commenter request. --Econlib Ed.]<\/p>","date":"Wed, 05 Nov 2014 09:58:00 GMT","type":"post"},{"id":7,"author":"Ben Smith","parentId":0,"text":"Thanks Russ!\nAnother great episode.

[Recording date: October 6, 2014.] <b>Russ:<\/b> Now, your paper, &quot;The Rise and Fall of General Laws of Capitalism,&quot; is a critique of both, in general, the idea that there <i>are<\/i> general laws; but in particular, you are taking aim at Thomas Piketty's book, <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century<\/i>. He was just recently a guest on EconTalk, discussing the book. And at the heart of your critique is a failure, you claim, on Piketty's part to take account in institutions. Explain what you mean. <b>Guest:<\/b> What I mean is that at some simple level, if you want to think about how economic outcomes, economic variables are determined, you know, if you go back to the way that we think about it, the way that we teach in our basic economics courses is that we talk about technology, supply side of the economy if you want to think about it that way. Preferences, the demand side. But there's always something that puts the two together. And in the basic, simple economic model, we have perfectly competitive markets or some sort of Cournot oligopoly. But of course reality is much more complicated. Government actions, actions by powerful groups in society through non-market means--bargaining, coercion, rent-seeking--all of those are in general part of this ensemble that put preferences and technology together to generate the outcomes that we care about. And broadly speaking we would refer to these as institutions, but [?] something else, but by institutions generally that's what we mean. And they have a life of their own. Not only do they matter; they also change. They change in response to the distribution of political power in society; they change in response to technology; they change in response to political demand coming from various quarters in society. And I think generally trying to formulate strong laws of how the capitalist system is going to evolve. Not that I am a big fan of the word 'capitalism,' by the way. Those laws are generally formulated for capitalism. Those sorts of laws generally ignore the role of institutions--both their impact but even more importantly their endogenous evolution. Because institutions make these sort of simplistic predictions much harder, because they mediate how these different sides of the market come together. <b>Russ:<\/b> Now, before we go any further, I want to defend Piketty. And then we'll get into the details. It's kind of a thrill for me--I don't get to defend him very often. So--I would argue that in his book he talks a reasonable amount about institutions. In fact, while I was reading his book, I knew that I was going to be interviewing you, and I came across a couple of quotes that suggest that he was at least sympathetic to your approach. I'm going to read one of them:<blockquote>In order to understand the dynamics of wage inequality, we must introduce other factors, such as the institutions and rules that govern the operation of the labor market in each society. To an even greater extent than other markets, the labor market is not a mathematical abstraction whose workings are entirely determined by natural and immutable mechanisms and implacable technological forces: it is a social construct based on specific rules and compromises.<\/blockquote> And I would argue that you could have written that paragraph, more or less. <b>Guest:<\/b> Right. <b>Russ:<\/b> And he has a few others like that. It's not the only one. There are not a lot of them. But how would you defend your critique against that quote? <b>Guest:<\/b> No, I think, you know, what I should say, and we should be more explicit about this, is not that Thomas generally ignores all sorts of factors other than capital and labor. But that these are not an integral part of the main arguments of his theory, in the same way that they weren't part of the main argument of Karl Marx's theory. At some level you can read Marx as a formulation of many important institutional dimensions of society. But when it comes to it, at the end, Marx's predictions are very much derived by abstracting from the various different effects of the institutional factors. But in particular, if you take all of the statements that Thomas makes, which include what you have just read, or in other places he puts a lot of emphasis on minimum wages for example or some [?] taxes--you know, you would say, yeah, all right, of course there are; he's suitably cautious in these things. But at the end of the day, the major predictions, the major force of his approach, which is that it's going to be the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate that is going to determine both the capital share and inequality in society, and these are the major forces which we have to understand about the revival or stability of the capitalist system, I think that's where institutions make <i>no<\/i> appearance. <i>And<\/i>, whenever institutions are sort of mentioned, such as wealth taxes or sometimes in the quotes[?] almost social norms that regulate the pay of the super-managers, etc., they are very much an outside construct. They are not part of what is changing and what needs to be explained. And that's what I am sort of drawing, we are sort of drawing the parallel to Marx, where, again, all those, there is an important institutional element in Marx, in particular his view of the Communist economy <i>is<\/i> an institutional one at some level--there is going to be a change from the capitalist to the communist or socialist to the communist. But his understanding or his explanation of how the capitalist system works in some sense is largely determined by some fundamental economic and accumulation force. <b>Russ:<\/b> I totally agree with that. I think there's some thoughtful analysis along the way. But when it comes to the bottom line it gets sort of pushed away, or ignored, or unemphasized. I think that's part of the problem with the book. It's not my main problem with the book. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">7:33<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> But let's continue. I want to start with Marx, because, as you do point out, Piketty's book is a, in some sense, there's certainly a wink if not a nod to Marx. In the title: the title of his book is <i>Capital<\/i>--<i>In the Twenty-First Century<\/i>. And Marx's book of course was called <i>Das Kapital<\/i>. So there is certainly a--and he writes a lot about Marx in the book--he certainly sees himself in that tradition, that grand tradition, not just focusing on capital but also in deriving general rules. So I thought it would be useful, certainly for me, and for our listeners, to hear: What were Marx's general rules? And what went wrong with them? <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, I mean I think Marx much more than Piketty had a very complex social theory, developed over many, many, many, many writings; and then put together in various different volumes--most importantly in <i>Das Kapital<\/i>, the first volume; and then posthumously, somewhat, some of them by Frederick Engels--Engels' and Marx's cooperation. So, anything you are going to say about Marx is going to be a simplification. But I think, doing that simplification, going along with that simplification--I would say that Marx had a conception which, in my opinion, and James Robinson's opinion, minimized [?] role. In two different ways. The first one is that his overall conception of how social, political, and economic outcomes were determined was a very materialistic one, in which, although in some of his works for example--most notably in the &quot;Eighteenth Brumaire&quot; he does talk about autonomous political factors--so the coup of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, etc.--at the end of the day he had a conception in which the <i>base<\/i>, the economic relations, determined everything else. So, though it is important, according to Marx to talk about political factors, those are very much shaped by the economic currents of the time and [?]. <i>And<\/i>, taking his cue from this overall framework, or historical materialism if you want to think of it or a simplified version, sort of, materialism, he did articulate several strong predictions or tendencies about how the capitalists work. In the paper, we emphasize three of those. One of them is the, sort of the general law of capitalist accumulation as he viewed it, which is about what's going to happen to real wages. See, here, Marx is a little less than fully specific. He does sometimes talk about real wages being [?] stagnant. But at all improvements in output and productivity go to capital, and sometimes the weaker form where, you know, the share of national income captured by labor declining over time, even if wages freeze from time to time. He does then talk about something else that's very well known, in Marxist economics: the general law of declining profits. And then later, he also talks about the general law of decreasing competition, which is, you know, the move toward monopoly capitalism--another one of the themes that <i>post<\/i>-Marxian economists have emphasized a lot. <b>Russ:<\/b> And those predictions didn't turn out so well. Why not? <b>Guest:<\/b> They did not. They did not. And I think, you know, the first one we know best. In fact Marx wasn't totally off target when he was writing. When he was writing was one of the most challenging things that people were aware, even if they did not have high quality data that we now have access to, is that, you know, there were a lot of things going on in the economy. The technological infrastructure of the economy was being totally revolutionized. And there were big monies being made by certain investors in corporations. But wages were stagnant or perhaps not doing so well for certain portions of the population. So out of this, Marx said, Look, labor is not going to benefit from all of these things, because this is all part of the nature of the capitalist. But, you know, that was happening in a given, particular, political, social, and technological context. The political and the social is actually very important, because when this was taking place, the balance of power in society was still very much a remnant of the old feudal time. Democracy was certainly sort of beginning to develop in Britain, with the First Reform Act, but was in a very, very embryonic form--was certainly not very active, and there wasn't representation in much of the rest of the Continent. And over time, so this balance of power started changing with greater democracy, greater franchise, greater representation, better organized labor, all sorts of regulations that changed how the pie would actually be divided. But even more importantly, the social and the political context determined the two most important factors shaping wages: human capital and technology. Together with these institutional, political institutional changes, came a whole revolutionary set of changes in the education. So, education ceased to be an elite activity, or the sons and daughters of the very prosperous, privileged part of the society-- <b>Russ:<\/b> Mostly the sons-- <b>Guest:<\/b> The sons, yes, that's right. <b>Russ:<\/b> At that time. Mostly the sons. <b>Guest:<\/b> Absolutely, absolutely, yes, that's what I should have said. <b>Guest:<\/b> And became basically available to the masses, although the whole sort of mass [?] movement in Europe and Britain did take a good part of the 19th century. And this was part of the super-rapid increase in the supply of skills during the 19th century, unprecedented relative to the past. Not that there <i>weren't<\/i> some very specialized skills. The British artisans were very skilled. There were pockets of highly skilled artisans and specialized workers in Continental Europe. But the whole work force became much more educated. And then, secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, for wages: the general environment, the institutional general environment, continued to support creation of better and better technologies and the scaling up of the employers that were willing to use that technology because they could outcompete their competitors, the incumbents in many cases, without very strong protection for these incumbents from the political powers. Big change, in some sense from the 18th century, for example. And with their ability to borrow, the financial markets, to patent and use and sell their innovations. So the whole sort of infrastructure of what we now view as the market economy got formed and developed in much of the 19th century. As this happened, the demand for labor increased; the demand for skilled labor increased. And all of these things kept pushing wages up. And in fact, somebody writing without so much reference to Marx, but just writing about trends in the second half of the 20th century, the most remarkable thing would have been the very steady increase in living standards over the last 100 years. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">16:26<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> Correct. And I think--let me--I want to push against both Piketty and your analysis. It seems to me that overwhelmingly, that rise in the living standards is due to two factors. Three. Maybe two and a half. And then I'll let you add--and then I'm going to see is left for institutions. So, we have the technological change. Which in itself is endogenous. It's a bit of hand waving to suggest it just sort of happens. That technological change certainly, as it goes along, requires, for it to continue, the application of capital. And that capital accumulation, which leads to technological change, leads to enormous improvements in productivity. And then the question becomes, for the Marxists: Why doesn't capital retain all the profit that it could? And I would answer that the main reason it doesn't isn't institutional. It's merely competition. Now, that is competition among profit seekers--entrepreneurs, corporations, etc.--forces them to share the gains with consumers, and then in turn with workers. Competition to acquire both customers and workers. Now, I will accept the argument, and I'll let you flesh it out--unless you want to push it in a different direction--that institutions determine how that competition plays out. Certainly that's true. But I think that role of competition in forcing--that's the right word; I don't think it's the best word but it's the only one I've got--forcing capitalists to share that bounty of that higher productivity with the general public, is the story of 1850-2014, even in the middle of this recession. And I'm curious what <i>you<\/i> think. But I don't understand about Piketty, and we can talk about this later--is, capital to me seems to be a crucial ingredient in the standard of living of the masses; and I don't understand how wars, which lower the amount of capital, are therefore good for the rest of us, but even though they are bad for the top 1%. I think they are bad for all of us. Not just the fact that people die, but because it does destroy capital. But just on <i>your<\/i> argument: what's the role for institutions in <i>my<\/i> story? What am I missing? <b>Guest:<\/b> Okay. So, I think you've got it absolutely right. I am 100% agreeing with you. Which is that what happened from 1850 is that technology moved apace. Human capital improved. Technology and human capital together created more and more demand for labor, pushed up marginal product of labor. And because labor markets were increasingly quasi-competitive, let's say--and I wouldn't go to say as far as saying they were competitive-- <b>Russ:<\/b> I don't know what that word means. Right? Competitive. It doesn't-- <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, what it means is--I'm not saying that wages were equal to the value of marginal product of labor-- <b>Russ:<\/b> Of course. <b>Guest:<\/b> But they were scaling up with the value of marginal productivity. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yup. <b>Guest:<\/b> So these factors together explain why the share of labor essentially remained constant together with GDP (Gross Domestic Product), wages increased and in some places actually share of labor increased faster than GDP. But what I disagree with you is the counterfactual. You are making the statement conditional on the institutions, in particular labor market institutions supported by the political institutions as we saw in the United Kingdom and in parts of Continental Europe. But those labor market institutions, supported by the specific social and political institutions of that time, were actually the exception in human history. And if you think about how labor markets worked, in much of Continental Europe, before and at the time of the French Revolution, <i>in<\/i> the United Kingdom actually, in the 17th century, 16th century, it would have been very, very different. And for instance, take places in which there was labor coercion. At the time that this was happening, or, you know, shortly before then, you still had labor coercion in many different parts of the world. And in those parts of the world there were huge swings in the value of marginal product of labor. For example, you had sugar prices fluctuate a lot and improve and increase the value of marginal product of labor of slaves in Jamaica and Cuba and Haiti. That did <i>not<\/i> translate into increases in the wages of labor. <b>Russ:<\/b> Great point. <b>Guest:<\/b> [?] example. But that didn't [?] because this was not in the context of a market economy. They key thing, and that's the institution part and that's why I think it's very important when I say that the Marxist theory and Piketty's theory don't have a role, or don't have an organic role for institutions: I really mean the evolution of institutions also. The crucial part is that these institutional structures, what was going on the labor markets, the representation of labor, the Chartist Movement and then the Trade Unions in the United Kingdom that represented the labor's interest, developed together with these more competitive, quasi-competitive markets, and led to an equitable distribution of the gains from economic growth--those same gains would not have been distributed equitably if Europe still had the institutions of the 1700s or the 1600s. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">22:11<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> Fair enough. And it's a great point. I do have a question though about modern improvements to the standard of living. I used to ask, when I would teach non-economists--law students or law professors or journalists or judges. I would ask them: Why is our standard of living in America higher than Mexico's? And I would often get the answer: Because we have a minimum wage and they don't. Yeah. Don't laugh. It's a common answer. And it's not a bad answer if you haven't thought about it a lot. And I would never laugh out loud, I want to say on the record, when I heard that. But the reason you laugh is that argument is very hard to sustain. There is not a lot of evidence for it. <b>Guest:<\/b> I don't mean to laugh--you know, I think if you want to explain why that certain <i>types<\/i> of workers in the United States have much lower wages than those workers in France, minimum wage is an excellent answer. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yes. That's correct. <b>Guest:<\/b> But I think, before you can get there you need to have a much greater institution parity. As you do have, with some important differences and distinctions between France and the United States. And that brings more, greater technological parity. But when you are comparing Mexico to the United States or Peru--you are [?] mistake-- <b>Russ:<\/b> Not going to work. Not going to work. <b>Guest:<\/b> Yeah. There are much more important first-order factors. <b>Russ:<\/b> Right. But the next argument you would hear is that we have unions and they don't. And I think that' a commonly held--let me make the argument more generally. When you ask, why was the 20th century so great in America overall despite a horrible depression, two world wars--lots of challenges? Why did it turn out so well? There are a lot of people who believe that it was the social legislation of the New Deal, the minimum wage, Social Security, certain bargaining laws for labor, Robinson-Patman, other types of innovations--I hope I had that right in terms of the timing--that forced capital to share the gains with labor. I just don't see that argument--empirically. I understand the argument, the idea behind it. In think empirically it's very hard to sustain that. <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, I disagree and I agree. I think my view is that, you know, think of it this way. So, I'm going to caricaturize my own view, but I think the view is [?]. You talked the competitive labor market. I think that competitive labor markets are actually a quite difficult thing. Nobody actually has an interest in a competitive labor market. Everybody would like to be a monopolist. Everybody would like to form coalitions with their friends and the people with whom they have <i>some<\/i> overlapping economic interest. And, with those coalitions, force for certain noncompetitive elements. So, at some point in human history you are going to find yourself close to the extreme of the slavery system that I just mentioned, where coercion is very strong. And even when coercion is not as strong there is huge imbalance of power because employers are monopsonistic; workers are in poverty or are being forced into poverty. For example, as in South Africa before the fall of apartheid. It's not just that you have coercion, which apartheid did exploit it. But also apartheid, as part of its existence, reorganized the entire labor force, pushed workers into these bantustans where they could not survive on agricultural, so that they would become cheaper labor for mines or for other white-controlled employers. In other periods, you are going to have, as you have had, getting a little weaker, but in parts of Continental Europe where unions are going to be so strong and employers are going to be so weak; so now you are going to have a situation and a wedge [?wage?]--unions are going to push for excessively high wages for their own members at the expense of other workers and at the expense of capital innovation in the economy. So, therefore, I cannot answer the question as to whether unions are <i>good<\/i> for the functioning of the economy or not. It really depends on what side of this tradeoff we are, or what side of this sort of balance we are. So if we are on the side of the balance where we were at the end of the 18th century, then I think it <i>was<\/i> important for the labor movement to play an important role, to balance that out. If you are where you were in Portugal, for example, in the end of the 1990s, perhaps it is <i>good<\/i> for unions to become sort of less able to push for innovation curtailing and business sort of killing high wages. So it's really the balance of where you are. So, I think--do I believe that it was important for Britain to have its labor movement become more well organized, more powerful, in the mid-19th century? Yes. Do I think that it was important for the United States for labor to become a little bit organized--it never became as organized, but at the beginning of the 20th century, so that some of the worst abuses, especially in terms of safety and child labor and other things that were going on in some marginal parts of the labor market, but not unimportant parts of the labor market in the United States? I think those were important. But I also don't think that you can generalize this to say that everywhere and under all circumstances you should push for stronger unions. Nor do I believe that the minimum wage or the Social Security legislation per se were that important for understanding the development of wages, development of living conditions in the United States--as you have already hinted at. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">28:37<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> So, one of the reasons I like talking to you is that you make me think about these things. You challenge my preconceptions. I'm going to give you one more, and then we'll move on. Because I find this extremely interesting. And I take your point about balance. But here's my puzzle. I have a cleaning woman who comes to my house with a crew of three people once a week. She speaks pretty good English. The three people she brings, they don't speak English very well. They don't have a union. Their bargaining power seems to me very limited in the way that bargaining power is talked about as an important art of labor market outcomes. They make a little over $23, $24 an hour--which is about, roughly three times the Federal minimum wage--I don't know what the state minimum wage is. <b>Guest:<\/b> These ladies--ladies do make? <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah. Each one. <b>Guest:<\/b> Wow. Very good. Wow, great. <b>Russ:<\/b> Well, it's hard to clean a house; it's hard to show up every time, every week on time; it's not pleasant work particularly; but if you do it well and you do it diligently, you make--you don't get any benefits; it's not great; it's hard to work 2000 hours a year doing it; you have travel time between things. It's not great. But their kids can go to college, actually in the United States, which is unbelievable; it's hard for them to get into more expensive ones sometimes or to be able to afford them. But they have a very different life here than they have in the countries that they came from. And the question I always as is: Why do I pay them three times the minimum wage? And it's not because I'm a nice guy. I <i>wish<\/i> it were. I like to think I'm a nice guy. But I pay them three times the minimum wage because if I don't, they don't come to my house. They have better alternatives. So, to me, competition, all this stuff about bargaining power and institutions, I don't see why it's so relevant. It seems to me that the technology--I'm going to come back to my original point: The supply and demand thing kind of powers through a lot of things. <b>Guest:<\/b> Okay. So, I think in your labor market, it might turn out that way, that $23 an hour, there's so many employers that are <i>individually<\/i> willing to hire these labors, that competition is able to take care of it. I think in many parts of the United States, despite the fact that the United States <i>is<\/i> as close as one gets to that, you know, peak of the balance that I just described, I would worry that the head lady will charge you $100 an hour, and then-- <b>Russ:<\/b> I'm sure she takes a disproportionate share. I don't think she divides it equally. <b>Guest:<\/b> And then will give each one of the other ladies $6. <b>Russ:<\/b> That could be. By the way, she drives a nicer car than I do. <b>Guest:<\/b> And that's because they are afraid that if they object to that, they are illegal or they have some other reasons to be afraid, and she is going to either drop them entirely or she is going to complain about them to the authorities. So they are in a very, very unequal, difficult bargaining position. And that the $100 that you are spending actually gets captured by the intermediary. And in fact, if there was better safety laws, perhaps these ladies would be compensated for doing some of the difficult job; or if there was, miraculously a better system in which people could not be taken advantage of in that way, their wages would be closer to the true value of their marginal product and as a result they will work even harder and we will have a more efficient and even a more liquid market. You know, one could tell stories. I don't know how the labor market in your area for cleaning ladies works. But I think the issue is that there are many pockets, even in as modern an economy as the United States which still in this day and age we <i>are<\/i> very [?] these issues. Still there are unequal labor relations. And you go to, you know, [?], the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, where migrant workers, who are paid so much better than they would have been paid had they stayed in Bangladesh or Pakistan or the Philippines, still are highly abused. And you can always say: Well, you know, labor demand, technology are going to take care of it. But it's a very slow process; and sometimes it <i>doesn't<\/i> because of the regulations, political power. Money is, all of them are on the side of the wealthy sheiks and princes in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. So, you know, it's a very, very unequal sort of fight, or unequal economic struggle between the migrant workers and their wealthy, powerful employers. <b>Russ:<\/b> I suspect that the labor market for cleaning people in the Boston area is very similar. But I take your point, especially with respect to how they are compensated within the group. I don't know. I may try to find out. Let's move on to Piketty. <b>Guest:<\/b> Let me know if you do. <b>Russ:<\/b> I will. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">33:31<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b>Let's move on to Piketty. So, Piketty has some general claims, and you talk about some of them in the paper that are a little bit on the technical side and don't lend themselves very well to audio. So, I'm going to leave those out. I'm going to focus on the big one. So, his biggest claim, the one that is the centerpiece of the book, is what he calls the central contradiction of capitalism: which is that the rate of return on capital, which he calls <i>r<\/i>, is going to almost always, or often is going to be greater than <i>g<\/i> which is the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and therefore holders of capital will see <i>their<\/i> well-being rise at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. And therefore inequality will grow inexorably. So, is that a fair summary, do you think, of his work? <b>Guest:<\/b> I think it's a very fair summary. <b>Russ:<\/b> So what's wrong with it? He treats it often as if it's just a mathematical truth. What's wrong with it? <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, I think there are several things wrong with it. I will classify them into four things that are wrong. First one is that the fundamental contradiction of capitalism is actually something that's implied by economic efficiency. So, in fact I think calling it a central contradiction of capitalism does create a little bit of a smoke-and-mirrors sort of thing. I'll come to that. Second, that to see this as an inexorable producer of inequality is at least theoretically--and I'll come back to the empirical part--wrong because <i>r<\/i>, the interest rate could be greater than <i>g<\/i> and that might still be consistent with stable inequality, decreasing inequality, lower inequality. Third, in focusing on <i>r<\/i> minus <i>g<\/i> in my opinion you are leaving out all of the more important determinants of inequality, all the institutional ones that we already talked about or those that come from other aspects of institutions[?] such as social mobility, for example, which I think is central. And then fourth, empirically, <i>r - g<\/i> doesn't do such a great job in explaining inequality or equality trend. So, those are the four things. Should I run through them? <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah, let's go. Go for it. <b>Guest:<\/b> So, first of all, <i>r - g<\/i> actually, you know--this is a small point, but let me start with it. And this is a technical point but I think it's an important one. In economics, in growth theory, we call economies that do not satisfy <i>r &gt; g<\/i> 'dynamically inefficient' economies. Because there is something fundamentally distorted about them. And in particular, if <i>r<\/i> were ever less or equal to <i>g<\/i>, less than <i>g<\/i>, let's take less than <i>g<\/i>, then you could actually make everybody better off in the economy without making anybody else worse. And that fundamentally the problem is that-- <b>Russ:<\/b> How? <b>Guest:<\/b> if <i>r<\/i> is less than <i>g<\/i>, that means that you are not properly compensating people for saving, which is an important economic activity; and as a result the economy generates too much capital. So, <i>r<\/i> minus <i>g<\/i> is a situation in which the economy has excessive amounts of capital. And it would be better for everybody else if it actually consumed some of that capital. And so, dynamic efficiency, what we sort of impose or expect the market economy to generate under fairly weak conditions, immediately leads to <i>r &gt; g<\/i>. So, rather than being a sort of a newly discovered fundamental fault line of the market economy or the capitalism economy, <i>r - g<\/i> is exactly what market economy should generate. And generally does generate; although there are periods in which economies do go into dynamically inefficient periods. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">37:57<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> Okay. So then--I'm going to take you off track for a minute; we may come back to the other three. But if it's actually a good sign for productivity and for the size of the pie, which is what dynamic efficiency is getting at, that phrase: if it's good for the growth or size of the pie, that <i>r<\/i> is greater than <i>g<\/i>, doesn't that <i>mean<\/i> that people who hold capital will see their nest egg, their savings, growing at a very high rate? And I'm just a poor wage earner; I'm just growing at a rate <i>g<\/i> if I'm lucky. I'm getting Piketty's story: international growth averages--sometimes it's higher, but in the developed countries it's usually between 2 and 3%. That includes population growth. So, productivity growth is 1-2%. And so that's the best I can hope for as a worker: I get a little booster throughout my life, but somebody who inherits money, they're getting <i>r<\/i>, so they are growing at a bigger rate, 5%, 7%. Doesn't that mean that the distance between the wage earner and the holder of capital is going to grow and grow and grow and over generations get even worse? <b>Guest:<\/b> So that's exactly my second point. So, the first one was that <i>r - g<\/i> is, it actually should be positive; that's quite basic economic theory we teach to all our students. And the second point is that <i>r - g<\/i> being positive doesn't actually imply increasing inequality. Yes, you're right--Thomas is right; and Thomas of course knows all of these things and in parts of the book he suitably caveats them. But let's take the most extreme version of the Pikettist position rather than Piketty's position, which would be: Yes, <i>r - g<\/i> is positive; that means that capital earners are going to have much, much, much, much higher, faster rates of growth of their wealth than workers. Well, that doesn't follow. That doesn't follow for several reasons. First of all, it's the case that not everybody is a capital owner all of the time. So, many people are saving for life-cycle reasons, or across generations they are saving to pass on to their kids, who are going to have lower earning potential. And if that's the case, you are not going to have that the translation--you are not going to have a direct translation of the rate of return on capital to the wealth of the capital owner's [?]. <b>Russ:<\/b> Plus-- <b>Guest:<\/b> More general point is that social mobility breaks this link between return to capital and where the capital owners are going to be. Social mobility here, I'm taking it a little bit broader than what we normally mean, which is that by social mobility we normally mean social intergenerational mobility. And we have quite a bit of that in the [?] economy. But here, I actually mean even more than that the fact that in your 40s you are going to be a very high earner; and then in your 60s you are going to live off the savings that you accumulated during your working. So all of those together imply that the link between, the gap between <i>r<\/i> and <i>g<\/i> and inexorably rising wealth inequality is tenuous at best. <b>Russ:<\/b> Let me extend your point, which is something we didn't talk about when I discussed this with Piketty. Which is, of course everyday people own stock as well. They have access to <i>r<\/i> through mutual funds; because probably the most--many of my guests changed the world in many kinds of ways. But I interviewed Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, and what he did is he democratized the access to capital through Vanguard's indexed mutual funds. It's an incredible revolution, really. Now it's true that not every single worker has access to it, but many, many do. And certainly more than, say, 50 years ago. And that's a wonderful thing. And Piketty ignores that. Of course, the other thing he ignores is that, as Bogle would point out, if you take what's called a buy-and-hold strategy and you buy a broad-based mutual fund, whether it's Vanguard's or somebody else's, you will do very well. You will earn the so-called market rate of return--pre-tax, of course. And you have to pay taxes on it--something Piketty often ignores. But pre-tax, you can earn that rate. Very few people's portfolios grow at that rate. For one reason, they diversify: they buy other things that are safer. Because there's risk in <i>r<\/i>, which is also often ignored. And secondly, they make mistakes. They get over-enthusiastic about return. They try to time the market. They waste a lot of money in fees. And we see the empirical evidence of this is overwhelming. You don't[?] have to do a study. You just have to look at what happens to rich people over time. They don't stay so rich. Not just they themselves, but their families [?] this over time, over generations. <b>Guest:<\/b> I think that second important, that's the important point, the second one you made, because I think Thomas is actually quite aware of that point. But he has a comeback to that, which is he would say--he doesn't emphasize this in the book although he doesn't articulate the criticism but he does respond to it at some level. He says: Capital income is very unequally held. So, capital is very unequally held. So, capital <i>income<\/i>, you know, yes, sure, the average worker does hold some stocks, true, Charles Schwab or Vanguard. But you know, it's very, very-- <b>Russ:<\/b> It's a small amount. And it's not a hedge fund; you can't get the return that hedge funds get. Of course many hedge funds go broke. <b>Guest:<\/b> But even if they were to get the same return-- <b>Russ:<\/b> Start with a smaller amount-- <b>Guest:<\/b> 99% would hold, you know, 50%, 60% of the capital stock, according to this view, and then the top 1% would hold 40% and then of course the return on capital would disproportionately go to the top 1%. But the key thing is that: Who is in that top 1%? If you look at who is in that top 1%, that changes over time. The people who are in the top 1% today, many, a large fraction of them were <i>not<\/i> in this top 1% 30 years ago. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah. His answer to that--I don't fully understand. I pointed that out to him. But his answer is: At the rate--when he points out that the rate of growth of the top 1% is growing, I say it's not the same people. And he still says, oh but this can't go on forever; eventually, even if the people are continually leapfrogging each other, I think he views it as somehow alarming that at some point in the future, the people, whoever they are, in the top 1%, will have too much political and economic power. <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, that's a different point. And we'll come back to that. And then I'll want to come back also to this issue--there is a little sleight of hand there, which is--again, I'm not sure whether I'm reading all of Thomas's statements accurately, but if my reading is accurate, he's saying: Look, capital is so important, capital is [?], capital is going to be the driver. But actually he's quite well aware, and his data from both the United States and France quite clearly show that the increase in inequality is not a capital phenomenon. It's a labor income phenomenon. So therefore what he's saying is that, sure it might be that's it's been labor income that's been driving the increase in inequality over the last 50 years, to an extent that we had not seen in the beginning of the 20th century, in the first half of the 20th century, or the 19th century. <i>But<\/i> it remains the case that <i>in the future<\/i> it will be capital that dominates. <b>Russ:<\/b> Great summary. <b>Guest:<\/b> We don't have any evidence for that. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah. That's a great point. I think that's exactly what's right or wrong about his analysis. With the caveat, as my listeners know, that I think the rise in labor inequality is grossly overstated because of demographic changes in the United States, because the analysis is households, not individuals; and there's been big changes in household formation and destruction because of divorce and delay-to-marriage date. And as a result when we see that trend it overstates the actual trend. But let's put that to the side, because that's a statistical issue. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">46:44<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> Let me get to a different point about the labor-income inequality. You can come back, make whatever the point you were going to make. I apologize. <b>Guest:<\/b> Okay. Yeah. Sure. You get to run this. You can take it wherever you want. <b>Russ:<\/b> I try not to take too much advantage of it. But you're very polite. You fault him for just &quot;presenting the data.&quot; I think one of the reasons his book has been so successful-- <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, that's the point I want to make, actually. That's my fourth point. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah. Make that point. Because on the surface, it seems like a selling point. All he does, it's just the facts, ma'am, just the facts. <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, let's come back to that. Can I--Let me cover the third one very briefly-- <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah, go ahead-- <b>Guest:<\/b> and then we can come to the fourth one, which is essentially the one that you're making. The third one is that even if you ignore the first two points that I made or if you take account of them but think they're not of course the end of the world for this point of view--but this point of view ignores the fact that there are so many other important determinants of inequality than <i>r - g<\/i>. And we try to, in the paper we try to illustrate that for example with the trends in inequality in Sweden and South Africa. And you can see quite easily there are <i>huge<\/i> changes in inequality in both of the countries over the 20th century. But none of it is related to <i>r - g<\/i>. None of it is related to wars or destruction of capital. So, they, are all deeply institutional. They are related to the formation of the social welfare state in Sweden. They are related to the nature of the apartheid regime which held black wages down but redistributed them among whites; and then the collapse of the apartheid regime, and so on. So that's a third one, which is that the focus on <i>r - g<\/i> might sort of involve throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The really interesting stuff left out. And then the fourth one is exactly the one that you made, which is: What does the data show? So, Thomas is doing a fantastic job of digging new data that is quite informative on a set of questions about economic [?] inequality. Together with Emanuel Saez and Tony Atkinson and a number of other researchers, he's been at the forefront of using tax returns data to shed new light on age old questions of inequality among economists and labor economists. But the literature has always been a very empirical literature. Which is that if you make a claim, then you look at the data not just in terms of the statistics, but you also provide the &quot;relevant correlations&quot; or the regressions--first starting with ordinary least squares regressions that sort of document what the correlations are. And then you worry about causality--what causes it? Is it really x causing y, or z causing x and y, or y causing x? So somehow surprisingly at some level, Thomas never does that. He sort of lays out the data. And he says, here are really interesting patterns. And I go with him <i>totally<\/i>--these are really interesting patterns. And he gets full credit for bringing those patterns to the attention of millions. But on the other hand, he then takes the next step, and he says, Well, here are the patterns and these are explained by <i>r - g<\/i> being positive and here they are explained by the World Wars, and here they are. But how do we know that? <b>Russ:<\/b> Had do you know? <b>Guest:<\/b> Have we done the cross-country correlation? Over-time correlation? Across households correlations? Or regressions? He never takes that step. And then, when you actually look at the data--for example, you do a very, very simple sort of correlational analysis and you say: Well, is it really true that in years or 5-year periods or decades during which <i>r<\/i> is greater than <i>g<\/i>, inequality increases? No. The data don't show that. So the data are quite clear that there doesn't seem to be a big correlation out there between <i>r - g<\/i> and inequality, top income share, or anything like that. <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">51:06<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> So, I want to come back to that. Because I think that's the central thing--it's a beautiful point. It's really what economics is all about: it's about complexity, and the challenges of trying to parse out causation. Which I think we have mixed success at. But before I do that, I just want to let you make one more comment about something else you note in the paper. Which is: You fault him for focusing on the top 1%. What's wrong with that? Isn't that important? What's your critique there? <b>Guest:<\/b> Oh, it's absolutely important; absolutely, absolutely important. But it's one of the many important things. Again, let me give the example of South Africa. South Africa <i>is<\/i> a case study in inequality. One of the most unequal countries in the world. It's been so for quite a while. But it's not about the top 1%. It's about blacks versus the rest of society. Or whites versus blacks and coloreds throughout the apartheid period. This is just like a beautiful political economy analysis; every aspect of South African society, from marriage to education, from labor market laws to political representation, they are all designed in order to keep blacks relatively poor economically, and make sure that whites get the lion's share of economic gain. But you are not going to see that with the top 1%. In fact, top 1% share <i>declines<\/i> throughout the period of the apartheid. So, if you just looked at the top 1% you'd say, well, this economy is doing well; the elite must be getting weaker over time. <b>Russ:<\/b> Part of that is a sort of a presumed focus on a zero-sum game. Which I think is--as you of course point out, and as he would point out: he understands it's not a 0-sum game. But when you talk about shares relentlessly you tend to get people's minds focused on it being a 0-sum game. And therefore you tend to miss some things. <b>Guest:<\/b> But I think there is one aspect in which I think Thomas is right, Thomas is right. As well as things like poverty--what's the bottom 10%, how the bottom 10% is doing. How is the median doing? The Gini coefficient, which Thomas hates but which is still a useful diagnostic. As well as all of those, we should look at the top 1%, both because of the many different dimensions of inequality that we should keep track of[?]. But there is an important element about top 1%. It might sort of ring alarm bells in our mind, which is that it is possibly, probably--probably--related to how dominant the economic elite in society are. So, if you have that the share of the top 1% is increasing very rapidly, it is right for us to worry about, as social scientists and for journalists to worry about in their investigative journalism role, about whether the society is being increasingly dominated politically, socially, and economically by a very small fraction of the population. So for example if the top 1% is becoming very, very rich at the same time as somehow--[?] sounds has some eerie relevance to the United States--if somehow money becomes more and more dominant in politics. <i>That<\/i>, you might actually worry about it, and you might say, Well, you know, top 1%'s share increased from 15% to 30%, and around that time, a lot of that money started flowing into politics, and then people like Sheldon Adelson are able to sort of finance particular candidates and then with very clear economic agendas about how gambling should be treated, etc.--well, that could be something quite problematic for the society. It could be quite dangerous for society. So we should actually think about this. But as my explanation here suggests, that we should really worry about the political and institutional aspects of it. Not just look at what's going on in the tax returns, but really think about the resilience of the institutions--which are the fault lines of the institutions? <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">56:22<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> Well, when you talked earlier--we're almost out of time; I want to bring us back to the beginning of your conversation, and I'll let you close us out. But you talked earlier, you said it's ironic--you didn't say it was ironic, but I was thinking it was ironic--that Marx was writing at a time when wages were stagnant; so we saw that he presumed that tomorrow was going to be like today, which is like yesterday; and therefore, there was going to be this perpetual stagnation. And he of course was writing this on the verge, on the cusp of the greatest leap in individual living standards that human history has ever seen. Kind of ironic. I remember being, in graduate school in the 1970s when very wise people whose names I won't mention explained how Microsoft--excuse me, IBM; I'm two generations ahead, one generation ahead--how IBM is a threat because they have a monopoly. This was a very long-running Department of Justice case, that pretty much, by the time it finished, IBM was almost irrelevant in the markets that were being discussed. And then we were told that Microsoft was a monopoly, and of course that also was a long-running case that turned out by the time it was done to be totally irrelevant. And you wonder whether people who make these grand pronouncements are doing so right at the time when reality and other market forces, other factors that are not observed-- <b>Guest:<\/b> It's called mean reversion, or Galton's Fallacy. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah, that's--thank you for giving it a little bit of an air of sophistication. But, having said all that, you, I know, are worried about inequality. I'm not, so much. I am worried about the political part; I am worried about the financial sector directing resources to itself. I think there is some inequality that's very bad. But I'm much more worried about opportunity. I'm much more worried about anti-poverty, and I'm much less worried about people who get really rich providing things that make a lot of people happy. So, tell me where you stand on this issue. Do you think-- <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, I think my view is not actually that different. But I think probably the emphasis is a little different. So, I think it's very useful to distinguish three roles[?rules?] of inequality. Or, three sorts of judgments that one can, and <i>should<\/i>, have about inequality. One is, holding everything else equal, how bad is it that the allocation of resources in the economy is more unequal? So, do a thought experiment; we hold everything else the same, but then we take a little bit of money from everybody below the 90% percentile and again give those money to the people above the 90% percentile. What is our economic judgment? Well, I think most people would be: That's not a good a good thing. You'll have some egalitarian judgments and so on. And you might have a social welfare function, diminishing returns in it, that once somebody has a lot already you don't want them to get more. Etc. But in general of course in reality not everything else is held the same. When you increase inequality you also encourage certain types of activities more, certain types of activities less. So I think we have to take all of these things into account. And I think it's a complex decision. And probably many people would be a little bit against inequality in this dimension. Some of them would be very against. But we have to find a way of aggregating these preferences. The second dimension I think is much more important; and you sort of somehow separated that but I think it's not as separable. Which is: equality of opportunity. I think most of us would be very troubled by an economic and political system where if you are born into a rich family you go to such schools and form such networks and get such a leg up in life that you are always going to be the boss. You are always going to have the most privileged position in life, even if you are not talented. Even if you haven't worked hard. Even if you haven't done anything. Just because you are born in the right family. And I think sort of the view that many people have is that as we make inequality greater, we also make this equality of opportunity harder to achieve. And I think there is some truth to that. For example, if you look in a world in which there are credit market constraints, then, you know, you can have easily a situation--this is I think the truth, reality in many developing countries--poor people cannot afford to go to school. And for people who live in neighborhoods that don't have schools, villages or poor neighborhoods, or they don't have high quality schools. And as a result, social mobility, equality of opportunity very strongly suffers. And in a situation like that, if you do indeed want social mobility, if you do indeed want equality of opportunity, then it might be one of the important levers to actually try to do something about inequality. But, if that's the case--now it's a parenthetical comment--who cares about top 1% inequality? Are we going to make equality of opportunity for blacks in our inner cities who are clearly suffering from this, for Hispanics, for poor people in the least educated socially economically most disadvantaged part of the United States if we take some money from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and give it to millionaires, so the top 1% declines? Of course that's totally irrelevant. The right thing to focus on is really poverty; it's really opportunities available to people at the bottom of the income distribution. And top 1% share is quite irrelevant. <b>Russ:<\/b> Well, it's ironic, because Bill Gates--that seems to be my word of this episode; I apologize for overusing it--but it <i>is<\/i> ironic that in your example, you mention Bill Gates. Bill Gates is desperately trying to <i>improve<\/i> the schooling system. I don't think he's very good at it, but he would love to see smaller inequality by boosting the bottom, as would I think almost everyone in the world. It's a great idea. We need a better school system. But that has nothing to do with the amount of capital that the rich hold or the power that they have. <b>Guest:<\/b> Right. And then the third element--and then I think you agree on this also but perhaps you might think about it as a little bit more separable than income inequality, is political inequality. I think many people, again perhaps not everybody, but I think an overwhelming majority of Americans would think that a system in which only a handful of people have political voice and the rest of us are like sheep is not a good system. One man, one vote, in reality, our politicians[?] are accountable and representative to all of us. I think that's the sort of system that we want. There is a concern, and I think it's a real concern, that as the rich become richer and richer, unless there are the right sort of institutional checks--competitive elections, open political system, the right sort of punishments and social norms against political corruption and political backroom deals--I think there's a real danger that the very, very rich might become politically so dominant that they can start tilting the system to their favor. And we in the United States, we are seeing some of that. So I think that last element is the one that I already mentioned. That's the one where the top 1% is important and we have to watch out for it. But that's a deeply institutional political economy channel. <b>Russ:<\/b> Yeah, I totally agree. Where we might disagree is where I want to see that improve is by limiting the power of government. And the people who tend to be worried about inequality often want to <i>increase<\/i> the power of government. And I see that as a hopeless strategy. The idea that we can make government more powerful so we can reduce inequality to me is, to be honest, a little bit naive. <b>Guest:<\/b> Well, I think it's--you know, again, I think it depends on the specific historical context that we are in. So, you are certainly right: if you are thinking about exploitation--again, let me go to an extreme case like the apartheid state or the slave plantation or the feudal system--government power is the <i>main method<\/i> of the wealthy and the powerful to exploit and extract from the rest of us. But if you are thinking of the Gilded Age, the end of the--so, the age of the robber barons--then we have a system there where these trusts are so powerful economically and are so able to use the legal system that they crush any opposition. They are able to sort of maintain their monopolies at the expense of creating greater entry, greater variety, lower prices for the consumers. So in that case what you need to do is, you need to do standard antitrust regulation. But to be able to do the antitrust regulation, you need the government to become stronger. Which is exactly what the Progressives actually achieved during that period. I think the biggest achievement of the Progressives was the political reform that made the Senate more accountable. But also the whole sort of antitrust apparatus--that, I think is very important why Marx's third prediction about increasing concentration didn't pan out. <b>Russ:<\/b> I guess I'm a little more skeptical than you are antitrust legislation does what economists thinks it does or want it to do. <b>Guest:<\/b> Oh, I mean, I am totally willing to go along with you that antitrust regulation often does get misused. And there are many distortions. But again in some extreme situations where the economy is becoming [?] monopolized, I think it certainly is very important, the way that society itself will monitor how economic power is [?] <\/td><\/tr> <tr><td valign=\"top\">1:05:23<\/td><td valign=\"top\"><b>Russ:<\/b> Well, we're over time. Why don't you close by talking about Piketty's book generally? Do you think it's an important book? <b>Guest:<\/b> Absolutely. How could anybody say that it's not an important book when you look at the impact it has had? I don't know how many copies it has sold, but you know, it must be in the millions. And it has transformed the debate; it has opened new debates. I think it's fantastic. I mean, it is true that it sort of became unusually successful partly because it did tap into a deep angst that people were already having about some of these issues; and it is building on decades of research in labor economics on inequality that many people were showing these striking inequality trends that existed in the United States that contrasted with some countries in Continental Europe, for example. The contrast between the United States and Scandinavia and France. And he built on all of this, and advanced that debate in many ways, and made lots of people interested in that debate. So there's a lot of things for us economists to sort of write more about. And that's the spirit in which James and I have written our piece--like the really interesting hypotheses that he had, we have to respond to it. And I think all of those are a great service and we should be all grateful to Thomas. What he's trying to do is a difficult one, and I think that probably is a balance that everybody has to sort of think about what's the optimal balance. He--what many economists or social scientists, especially economists do, is that, you know, we write academic papers to advance new ideas. And then we write popular pieces to sort of popularize those ideas, or introduce those ideas to a broader public or policy-makers, etc. So, Thomas tried to do both in the same volume. And I think there is a tension in there; and I think it's not clear what part of it is a scientific, academic statement about comparative statics or the effect of x on y empirically, and what part of it is an appeal to his readers, his natural readers, that: I really think there is something deeply unfair about this and I really think it's x that's important even if the data is not there. I think those sort of statements are also fine, but when the two are mixed sometimes I think it's not as easy to parse what is what. And that's the spirit in which the institutions are mentioned. Yes, minimum wage is important, the wealth tax is important; but if you look at his theoretical model, they are not at the center of it, and that's what I was trying to say at the beginning.

At 17, Christy is a typical teenager. Until two months ago, the most pressing question on her mind was what to study at college: engineering or physiotherapy?\nNow, she\u2019s juggling classes with stints manning barricades in Hong Kong, bracing for an anticipated sweep by police to clear student-led protesters camped out on major roads for eight weeks to demand greater democracy. Christy rushes to the protest site after school, where she does her homework and sometimes sleeps over in a tent, wrinkling her uniform.\nHer support for the protests has led to screaming fights with her mother, she said, as well as sneers from classmates and disapproval from some teachers. Like the hundreds of other school children, some as young as 14, participating in the movement, her bravado is tempered by worries about the impact on her future.\n\u201cI understand that I should be focused on studying, on getting into a good university, on building a bright career to make my parents proud,\u201d said Christy, who asked not to be identified by her full name for fear of reprisals. \u201cI think it\u2019s because we\u2019re so educated that we know right from wrong. It\u2019s clear to me that everything I\u2019m doing right now is related to the future I want to live in.\u201d\nPhotographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg\nHong Kong\u2019s youth are the stalwarts of protests that have sparked the city\u2019s biggest political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule from Britain in 1997. The students have been called radical by the city\u2019s leader, while some Chinese officials have taken a softer line, calling them misguided for demanding the public be allowed to nominate candidates in the leadership election in 2017.\nGeneration Gap\nWhile they have yet to win concessions from the government, their disciplined resistance has catapulted the students from relative obscurity to being the most recognized political group in the city. The emergence of a brasher generation taking over from established pro-democracy campaigners portends decades of political struggle ahead.\nChristy never intended to sleep on the streets, she said in a series of interviews over the past month. Although her interest in politics was awakened by demonstrations that defeated a government proposal to introduce a Chinese national education plan two years ago, she kept away from pro-democracy rallies in the summer to focus on her studies.\nThat changed Sept. 28, a day when she was to run a race around Disneyland. She was following on TV and Facebook as thousands of people poured on to the streets to support students who had been pepper sprayed by police as they occupied a public square to protest China\u2019s plans for the election.\nShe ditched her race and carried bottles of water on the subway to the protest site in Admiralty. By nightfall, she was swept up in the throng of pro-democracy protesters, on her knees sobbing amid a cloud of tear gas.\nFriends United\nThe day after, still holding her helmet and eye goggles, she stood in front of her classmates, recounting the events of the night. The daughter of a former policeman, Christy cried as she told them she was heartbroken that officers had used tear gas on peaceful crowds.\nThey answered in tears, rushing up to give her hugs.\n\u201cOur fight for democracy touches so many things in society, and is really about changing people\u2019s lives for the better,\u201d Christy said in one interview, occasionally flicking her finger on her orange phone to check Facebook updates on the protests. \u201cThere are too many voices that are muffled.\u201d\nSince that night, Christy has returned almost every day, studying with books or on her iPad and chatting with other young people who munch on pizza and home-made dishes brought by parents and sympathizers. She\u2019s put aside her passions such as skateboarding and dancing to focus on the cause, and misses time spent with her pet cat.\nParental Rift\nShe has remained as the crowds waxed and waned from student estimates of 200,000 to as few as several hundred. Her dedication hasn\u2019t come without cost.\nChristy\u2019s participation has been a constant source of tension with her mother. The two are close -- going on joint holidays and shopping trips -- yet have different values, Christy said.\nAfter weeks of heated arguments and getting \u201cthe silent treatment\u201d over sneaking off to the protests, Christy said she slept a few nights at the camp site while refusing to answer her mother\u2019s calls.\nHer mother became frantic, calling Christy\u2019s friends in tears. Then she sent a Whatsapp message to Christy with a photo of her holding Christy as a baby.\n\u201cI felt so, so guilty at that point,\u201d she said. \u201cI called my mother and told her I was safe. That I knew what I was doing. That I wasn\u2019t here for fun and I\u2019m only here to fight for my future.\u201d\nSchool Divided\nThe two compromised after an emotional conversation.

At 17, Christy is a typical teenager. Until two months ago, the most pressing question on her mind was what to study at college: engineering or physiotherapy?<\/p>\n<p>Now, she&rsquo;s juggling classes with stints manning barricades in Hong Kong, bracing for an anticipated sweep by police to clear student-led protesters camped out on major roads for eight weeks to demand greater democracy. Christy rushes to the protest site after school, where she does her homework and sometimes sleeps over in a tent, wrinkling her uniform.<\/p>\n<p>Her support for the protests has led to screaming fights with her mother, she said, as well as sneers from classmates and disapproval from some teachers. Like the hundreds of other school children, some as young as 14, participating in the movement, her bravado is tempered by worries about the impact on her future.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I understand that I should be focused on studying, on getting into a good university, on building a bright career to make my parents proud,&rdquo; said Christy, who asked not to be identified by her full name for fear of reprisals. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re so educated that we know right from wrong. It&rsquo;s clear to me that everything I&rsquo;m doing right now is related to the future I want to live in.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/photo/hong-kong-protester-/-imasqt9SO5Kk.html\"><figure><img src=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/image/iIBYWbkTg.Ds.jpg\"><\/img><figcaption> Christy, 17, wearing a yellow ribbon holds a paper umbrella. <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/a> <figcaption> Photographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg <\/figcaption>  <\/figure>\n<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s youth are the stalwarts of protests that have sparked the city&rsquo;s biggest political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule from Britain in 1997. The students have been called radical by the city&rsquo;s leader, while some Chinese officials have taken a softer line, calling them misguided for demanding the public be allowed to nominate candidates in the <a href=\"http://www.2017.gov.hk/en/home/\">leadership election<\/a> in 2017.<\/p>\n<h2>Generation Gap <\/h2>\n<p>While they have yet to win concessions from the government, their disciplined resistance has catapulted the students from relative obscurity to being the most recognized political group in the city. The emergence of a brasher generation taking over from established pro-democracy campaigners portends decades of political struggle ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Christy never intended to sleep on the streets, she said in a series of interviews over the past month. Although her interest in politics was awakened by demonstrations that defeated a government proposal to introduce a Chinese national education plan two years ago, she kept away from pro-democracy rallies in the summer to focus on her studies.<\/p>\n<p>That changed Sept. 28, a day when she was to run a race around Disneyland. She was following on TV and Facebook as thousands of people poured on to the streets to support students who had been pepper sprayed by police as they occupied a public square to protest <a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/china/\">China<\/a>&rsquo;s plans for the election.<\/p>\n<p>She ditched her race and carried bottles of water on the subway to the protest site in Admiralty. By nightfall, she was swept up in the throng of pro-democracy protesters, on her knees sobbing amid a cloud of tear gas.<\/p>\n<h2>Friends United <\/h2>\n<p>The day after, still holding her helmet and eye goggles, she stood in front of her classmates, recounting the events of the night. The daughter of a former policeman, Christy cried as she told them she was heartbroken that officers had used tear gas on peaceful crowds.<\/p>\n<p>They answered in tears, rushing up to give her hugs.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our fight for democracy touches so many things in society, and is really about changing people&rsquo;s lives for the better,&rdquo; Christy said in one interview, occasionally flicking her finger on her orange phone to check Facebook updates on the protests. &ldquo;There are too many voices that are muffled.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since that night, Christy has returned almost every day, studying with books or on her iPad and chatting with other young people who munch on pizza and home-made dishes brought by parents and sympathizers. She&rsquo;s put aside her passions such as skateboarding and dancing to focus on the cause, and misses time spent with her pet cat.<\/p>\n<h2>Parental Rift <\/h2>\n<p>She has remained as the crowds waxed and waned from student estimates of 200,000 to as few as several hundred. Her dedication hasn&rsquo;t come without cost.<\/p>\n<p>Christy&rsquo;s participation has been a constant source of tension with her mother. The two are close -- going on joint holidays and shopping trips -- yet have different values, Christy said.<\/p>\n<p>After weeks of heated arguments and getting &ldquo;the silent treatment&rdquo; over sneaking off to the protests, Christy said she slept a few nights at the camp site while refusing to answer her mother&rsquo;s calls.<\/p>\n<p>Her mother became frantic, calling Christy&rsquo;s friends in tears. Then she sent a Whatsapp message to Christy with a photo of her holding Christy as a baby.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I felt so, so guilty at that point,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I called my mother and told her I was safe. That I knew what I was doing. That I wasn&rsquo;t here for fun and I&rsquo;m only here to fight for my future.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<h2>School Divided <\/h2>\n<p>The two compromised after an emotional conversation. She promised to go home more often and not to go to the volatile protest zone in Mong Kok.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know many people think we&rsquo;re just silly kids, asking for so much before contributing anything to society,&rdquo; said Christy, wearing a T-shirt and canvas shoes while keeping watch over rows of multi-colored tents. &ldquo;The thing is, some things you don&rsquo;t do today, you won&rsquo;t be able to do tomorrow.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>She has faced tension at her Catholic-run school too, where she says she is on the athletics team.

But the pace isn\u2019t all that fast, and the overall level of global connectedness still hasn\u2019t gotten back to its all-time peak of 2007. The overwhelming majority of commerce, investment, and other interactions still occur within \u2014 not between \u2014 nations.\nThat\u2019s the message from the just-released DHL Global Connectedness Index 2014, which combines measures of trade, capital, people, and information flows to give a picture of how entwined we citizens of the world are with each other. Here\u2019s the headline chart, with the subindexes for \u201cdepth\u201d (the volume of flows) and breadth (how widely distributed the flows are among different countries):\nThe index is compiled by Pankaj Ghemawat, a professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business and the IESE Business School in Barcelona, and Steven Altman, a lecturer at IESE. Ghemawat, a frequent HBR contributor, began arguing in 2007, with the book Redefining Global Strategy, that the world isn\u2019t nearly as flat as Tom Friedman said it was. As he put it that year in Foreign Policy magazine:\nDespite talk of a new, wired world where information, ideas, money, and people can move around the planet faster than ever before, just a fraction of what we consider globalization actually exists. The portrait that emerges from a hard look at the way companies, people, and states interact is a world that\u2019s only beginning to realize the potential of true global integration. And what these trend\u2019s backers won\u2019t tell you is that globalization\u2019s future is more fragile than you know.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent global recession demonstrated that fragility, as trade flows shrank dramatically. And in 2011, after Ghemawat published another globalization book, World 3.0, global logistics giant DHL asked him to put together an annual index of globalization\u2019s progress (or regress). When I asked Ghemawat if it wasn\u2019t a little bit weird for a champion of globalization like DHL to commission such research from a globalization skeptic, he laughed and said, \u201cIf the world were already connected, they couldn\u2019t trumpet what a role they play in connecting it.\u201d\nThe big news in the chart above, other than global connectedness getting back close to its 2007 peak, is that the breadth of connectedness is still declining. Breadth is a measure that reflects how many different countries a particular country is interacting with and the distances over which interactions occur, among other things. So the tourist trade in the Bahamas, while it scores high for depth because there are lots of tourists, doesn\u2019t have much breadth because more than 80% of them come from one country, the U.S., that is less than 200 miles away and accounts for less than 10% of the world\u2019s outbound tourists.\nThis global decline in the breadth of connectness, Ghemawat says, suggests that \u201cwith the big shift in economic activity to emerging markets, the world is in some sense getting pulled apart.\u201d For the past couple of decades, globalization been largely driven by trade, investment, and other interactions between developed countries and developing ones. Now the action is among the developing countries (and formerly developing countries), which is having the effect of re-regionalizing many economic flows. South-to-South trade is now growing faster than South-to-North or North-to-South, Ghemawat says, while North-to-North trade \u201chas basically stagnated.\u201d\nThe index\u2019s different \u201cpillars\u201d of connectedness have also followed different trajectories over the past decade:\nTrade, as already noted, took a big hit and has now rebounded. The number of people studying or working outside their home country hasn\u2019t changed much, while the information index has been rising fast. (The capital measure is a moving three-year average, because otherwise it would be too volatile to make sense of.) But the information flows have been rising from a pretty low base: Less than 20% of internet traffic crosses borders, and fewer than 5% of telephone calls do. The international calls that are made tend to follow immigration routes:\nOf the international calls measured here, 41% are made from advanced economies to emerging ones. The route with the most calling minutes, by far, is from the U.S. to Mexico, and second is the U.S. to India.\nSo the world is still far from flat. And it\u2019s not even getting that much flatter.","pageUrl":"http://t.co/GsPOSWxAVd","humanLanguage":"en","type":"article","date":"Mon, 03 Nov 2014 00:00:00 GMT","resolvedPageUrl":"https://hbr.org/2014/11/the-world-is-still-not-flat/","author":"Justin Fox","title":"The World Is Still Not Flat","diffbotUri":"article|3|1385735655","images":[{"diffbotUri":"image|3|1886813472","naturalHeight":675,"primary":true,"naturalWidth":1200,"url":"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/11/2014NOV4-3.jpg"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|1596264214","naturalHeight":329,"naturalWidth":365,"url":"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/globalizationsslow.png"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|-2093417541","naturalHeight":330,"naturalWidth":365,"url":"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/globalizingatdifferent.png"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|1267160216","naturalHeight":312,"naturalWidth":580,"url":"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/whosphoningwhom.png"}],"html":"<p>  Loading... <\/p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/11/2014NOV4-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"2014NOV4-3\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/11/2014NOV4-3.jpg\"><\/img><\/a><\/figure>\n<p>Globalization marches on.

Ghemawat, a frequent HBR contributor, began arguing in 2007, with the book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Redefining-Global-Strategy-Crossing-Differences/dp/1591398665/\">Redefining Global Strategy<\/a>,&nbsp;<\/em>that the world isn&rsquo;t nearly as flat as <a href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/09/19/8272896/index.htm\">Tom Friedman said it was<\/a>. As he <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2007/02/14/why_the_world_isnt_flat\">put it that year in <em>Foreign Policy<\/em> magazine<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote> <p>Despite talk of a new, wired world where information, ideas, money, and people can move around the planet faster than ever before, just a fraction of what we consider globalization actually exists. The portrait that emerges from a hard look at the way companies, people, and states interact is a world that&rsquo;s only beginning to realize the potential of true global integration. And what these trend&rsquo;s backers won&rsquo;t tell you is that globalization&rsquo;s future is more fragile than you know.<\/p> <\/blockquote>\n<p>The financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent global recession demonstrated that fragility, as <a href=\"http://www.voxeu.org/article/big-drop-trade-and-great-recession\">trade flows shrank dramatically<\/a>. And in 2011, after Ghemawat published another globalization book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/World-3-0-Global-Prosperity-Achieve/dp/142213864X\"><em>World 3.0<\/em><\/a>, global logistics giant DHL asked him to put together an annual index of globalization&rsquo;s progress (or regress). When I asked Ghemawat if it wasn&rsquo;t a little bit weird for a champion of globalization like DHL to commission such research from a globalization skeptic, he laughed and said, &ldquo;If the world were already connected, they couldn&rsquo;t trumpet what a role they play in connecting it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The big news in the chart above, other than global connectedness getting back close to its 2007 peak, is that the breadth of connectedness is still declining. Breadth is a measure that reflects how many different countries a particular country is interacting with and the distances over which interactions occur, among other things. So the tourist trade in the Bahamas, while it scores high for depth because there are lots of tourists, doesn&rsquo;t have much breadth because more than 80% of them come from one country, the U.S., that is less than 200 miles away and accounts for less than 10% of the world&rsquo;s outbound tourists.<\/p>\n<p>This global decline in the breadth of connectness, Ghemawat says, suggests that &ldquo;with the big shift in economic activity to emerging markets, the world is in some sense getting pulled apart.&rdquo; For the past couple of decades, globalization been largely driven by trade, investment, and other interactions between developed countries and developing ones. Now the action is <em>among<\/em> the developing countries (and formerly developing countries), which is having the effect of re-regionalizing many economic flows. South-to-South trade is now growing faster than South-to-North or North-to-South, Ghemawat says, while North-to-North trade &ldquo;has basically stagnated.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The index&rsquo;s different &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; of connectedness have also followed different trajectories over the past decade:<\/p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/globalizingatdifferent.png\"><img alt=\"globalizingatdifferent\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/globalizingatdifferent.png\"><\/img><\/a><\/figure>\n<p>Trade, as already noted, took a big hit and has now rebounded. The number of people studying or working outside their home country hasn&rsquo;t changed much, while the information index has been rising fast. (The capital measure is a moving three-year average, because otherwise it would be too volatile to make sense of.) But the information flows have been rising from a pretty low base: Less than 20% of internet traffic crosses borders, and fewer than 5% of telephone calls do. The international calls that are made tend to follow immigration routes:<\/p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/whosphoningwhom.png\"><img alt=\"whosphoningwhom\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/whosphoningwhom.png\"><\/img><\/a><\/figure>\n<p>Of the international calls measured here, 41% are made from advanced economies to emerging ones. The route with the most calling minutes, by far, is from the U.S. to Mexico, and second is the U.S. to India.<\/p>\n<p>So the world is still far from flat. And it&rsquo;s not even getting that much flatter.<\/p>","docId":258071148350,"gburl":"http://t.co/GsPOSWxAVd-diffbotxyz3789152325","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1420322888,"timestamp":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 22:08:08 GMT"}

We\u2019ve all had our encounters; we\u2019ve all been in situations where being black becomes synonymous with being suspicious, where demanding rights and respectful treatment can be seen as resisting law enforcement.\nSo after the grand jury\u2019s decision on Monday not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., I found myself thinking back on episodes in my own life. My first thought was: What\u2019s the difference between a 6-foot-3-inch, 230-pound, black 17-year-old and a 40ish, 5-foot-6-inch black man? Depending on the circumstances, I knew, not much.\nIt was the late 1970s, and I was that large, 17-year-old, high-school kid\u2014getting good grades and college-bound. I was walking home from Bowlero, a bowling alley in Alexandria, La., on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I was carrying my bowling bag, complete with a 16-pound ball, shoes and a towel.\nI noticed police cars speeding around. Several passed before a Louisiana state trooper stopped. He told me to be careful: There had been a fatal shooting in my neighborhood, and the suspect\u2014a 5-foot-6-inch black man\u2014had escaped on a bicycle.\nI walked on until I heard a screech of brakes and looked back. A Rapides Parish sheriff\u2019s deputy\u2014Louisiana has parishes, not counties\u2014got out, crouched behind his car door and pointed his .357-Magnum at me over the top of the door. When you\u2019re on the wrong end of it, the barrel of a .357 looks exactly like a tunnel to eternity.\nI knew a few things instinctively: Don\u2019t run, don\u2019t move, don\u2019t argue, and above all, don\u2019t ask why I\u2019d been stopped. Stay calm to live, I thought. The cop had the gun, but it was my responsibility not to do anything to push him to use lethal force against me.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cTurn around real slow,\u201d he said. That\u2019s just what I did. I asked if it was OK to put down the bowling bag, slowly. I knew I had to do everything I could not to create any fear in the officer. Dead but innocent is still dead.\nI said little, even as the deputy pushed me down on the hood of his car and handcuffed me.\nI was saved when the state trooper who had first stopped me drove back by. He ripped into the deputy, asking him questions, and I answered\u2014which, in another situation, could have been a comedy routine. Does this kid look 5-6? I answered, I\u2019m 6-3. Does this kid look 40? I\u2019m 17. Does this kid look 150 pounds? I\u2019m 230.\nThe trooper ran through several descriptors for the suspect. I matched just one of them. I asked, \u201cOutside of the basic black, is there any part of the description I fit?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get smart, boy,\u201d the deputy hollered. But the trooper, who also was white, ended the discussion. He was livid. I thank God for him.\nYears later, there is still no doubt in my mind that if I had moved in any way that frightened or angered the deputy, he would have shot me, and a reason would have been found to justify it.\nAs a teenager, there were other times when I was seen as \u201csuspicious.\u201d Once, a store manager hid outside the supply freezers at a fast-food restaurant where I worked. At first, I thought he was playing a prank to scare me; only later did I learn that he suspected the black employees of stealing boxes of hamburger patties. In fact, the kids from affluent white families were taking the burgers and having cookouts with their friends. I wasn\u2019t one of the invitees. My future was worth more to me than a box of hamburger meat\u2014even when I was a teenager.\nI found myself a target of suspicion on other occasions too. At the state junior bowling tournament in Baton Rouge in 1979, a group of my teammates set about trashing the hotel\u2014drinking, shouting and running the halls. I knew beforehand that they were likely to misbehave, so I got a room to myself on the other side of the hotel.\nBut that didn\u2019t stop hotel security, accompanied by a city police officer, from coming to my room first. They flashed their badges and entered, only to see textbooks laid out on the bed. I was studying for tests on Monday. I was the only minority kid on the team. To my knowledge, none of my teammates got the same official attention.\nAs a teenager, I could be a doofus, but I knew even then that my margin for error was nonexistent compared with that of my friends and co-workers. On a perfectly beautiful day, I could be suspicious enough to a police officer that I would end up on the wrong end of a gun barrel.\nFor many black men in America, that margin of error has not improved. I don\u2019t condone the rioting in Ferguson, but it might help if the rest of the country had some small sense of the frustration and anger that this situation continues to cause.","title":"What It Felt Like to Be a \u2018Suspicious\u2019 Black Teenager","diffbotUri":"article|3|-1393442759","pageUrl":"http://t.co/rXkSPaXYyP","images":[{"title":" A young man kneels before a line of Los Angeles police officers about to charge at protesters reacting to a grand jury\u2019s decision Monday not to indict a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo.

Why, in the midst of all of this, should we continue to share it?\nHealth Data in the Digital Era\nFirst, the law: Health care privacy and security is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which limits disclosure of patient data and mandates secure storage and transmission of electronic records. Anybody who violates HIPAA faces civil and criminal penalties. So the law ensures that providers and health plans take steps to protect your health data and that you retain important rights over how it is used.\nToday, de-identified data that you share is driving the most important advance in medicine: population-based data discoveries and tools to manage our health, wellness, and diseases.\nThe signs of digital medicine are everywhere: Four out of every five office-based physicians use electronic health records. The government is releasing new population health data. And the 85 percent of buyers of new handsets who are selecting smartphones will expect to access personal health data on their devices.\nWe know that health systems charged with keeping this data private have struggled. A cyber-attack this year on a Tennessee-based hospital system, for example, accessed the data of 4.5 million patients. A single hacker penetrated HealthCare.gov this summer. And the industry of collecting and selling personal health data keeps getting bigger.\nThese problems are real, and we have to solve for them. But they should not impede the advances in health care on the horizon. The next big breakthrough in medicine could develop because you shared your health information. All of us\u2014patients, providers, and entrepreneurs\u2014have a stake in making this happen.\nThe Patient Perspective\nPatients should first understand just how much they benefit when providers and researchers can access their health data electronically in real-time. Your data helps your physician manage your health by providing ongoing, longitudinal, and integrated access to your information within and across providers. Pharmacists will have quick insight into all of the medications you are taking and how they interact, reducing the prescription errors that cause so much damage.\nMoreover, population-based de-identified patient data has already produced advances against such diseases as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure. Given that five percent of the U.S. population accounts for half of health care costs, population data lets researchers tackle the most vexing problems in medicine. By opting in and sharing your data, you promote the research breakthroughs that can one day improve your own health and help people who are suffering from similar health issues.\nBut patients have to watch out for the marketing and data brokerage firms that trade in health information and that, as the Federal Trade Commission noted, \u201coperate with a fundamental lack of transparency.\u201d Consider the purpose before you provide personal information to entities not covered by the HIPAA laws that apply to physicians and researchers. Patients should also check if the devices that they are using to track their health information are HIPAA-compliant. In this new era of the quantified self, ask first before uploading data from an unknown source.\nThe Provider Perspective\nProviders today are using electronic tools to schedule appointments, receive ongoing patient metrics, customize treatments, and communicate via telemedicine. The tools, by improving access to patient data, save time, save money, and enable providers to deliver better care.\nThis matters because the world of fee-for-service is evaporating. In the new era of value-based care demonstrated by the rising number of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), these digital tools will be critical for your livelihood as a provider and you will want to embrace them.\nBut you also must institute advanced security protocols for the data that you use. While all hospital systems have general compliance functions, they need to prioritize these efforts. At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, for example, officials encrypted devices, tightened access to cloud-based services, and strengthened network access controls after several data breaches.\nBeyond the significant direct costs that arise from a breach, providers who want patients to continue to provide data for treatment and research must show that they will protect the data. Providers should teach patients how to protect their own data as well.\nThe Entrepreneurs\u2019 Perspective\nThere has never been a better time to be an entrepreneur interested in changing health care through the use of digital technology and tools. We are even seeing patients and their parents taking steps themselves to improve the software and data capabilities of the medical technology that they use. But to be successful in this space, you need to know what you do not know.\nIn addition to HIPAA, entrepreneurs should know the evolving definition of what the Food and Drug Administration will regulate. Apps that are used for diagnosis or that provide a therapeutic recommendation may fall under FDA purview. But do not let these regulatory burdens intimidate you: our health care system needs your creative and altruistic instincts.\nWhat you do need to do is respect the nature of the data, remembering that it\u2019s not just data on the buying preferences of a consumer but data that can save a life. Apple, for example, has instituted new privacy and security requirements for health apps in its App Store even though HIPAA may not apply to user-generated data on mobile health apps. Empathize with consumers and earn their trust.\nA New Age of Medicine\nUntil recently, as my colleague John Doerr observed, there was \u201cmore information technology in your average grocery store than in your doctor\u2019s office.\u201d Now, digital technology is here to stay.\nBut if we truly want to enable the breakthroughs and behavior changes that will transform our health, we must be willing to share our most personal asset: the data about our lifestyle, state of health, and disease.\nThe privacy laws are not perfect. No system is fail-safe. More breaches will happen. But let\u2019s not let the perfect be the enemy of good. Big data will enable you to make better decisions and, at the population level, will lead to new insights, new discoveries, and better health for everyone.\nSharing your most personal asset may be the best decision of your life.","pageUrl":"http://t.co/mxRwLziQko","humanLanguage":"en","type":"article","date":"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 00:00:00 GMT","resolvedPageUrl":"http://www.kpcb.com/blog/you-should-share-your-health-data-its-value-outweighs-the-privacy-risk","author":"Beth Seidenberg","title":"You Should Share Your Health Data: Its Value Outweighs the Privacy Risk","diffbotUri":"article|3|1972204602","images":[{"diffbotUri":"image|3|2071771807","naturalHeight":712,"primary":true,"naturalWidth":712,"url":"http://kpcbweb2.s3.amazonaws.com/content/739/sm_health-data-inline-660x660.jpg"}],"html":"<figure> <img alt=\"You Should Share Your Health Data: Its Value Outweighs the Privacy Risk\" src=\"http://kpcbweb2.s3.amazonaws.com/content/739/sm_health-data-inline-660x660.jpg\"><\/img> <\/figure>\n<p><i>This article first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/11/on-sharing-your-medical-info/\">Wired<\/a> on Nov 6, 2014 <\/i><\/p>\n<p>From genome-based therapeutics and diagnostics to pulse-monitoring smart watches, health data is transforming medicine.<\/p>\n<p>But it is also alarming patients, who&mdash;aware of the recent cyber-attacks against Target, Home Depot, and JPMorgan that stole personal data from millions of people&mdash;are scared that their privacy will be invaded.<\/p>\n<p>Our health data is our most personal asset.

While prices are falling partly because of abundant global supply, China\u2019s slowing growth is also having a knock-on effect across Asia, reducing demand for the region\u2019s exports.\nA pickup in the U.S. economy, a bright spot for demand, is counterbalanced by Europe\u2019s continued troubles. Japan\u2019s fall into a technical recession in the third quarter, meanwhile, could keep prices in the region from rising further.\nThe risk to Asia is that low inflation becomes entrenched, mirroring Japan\u2019s troubles of recent years and making it harder for companies and households to repay debt, said Chetan Ahya, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to cut rates to get out of this problem,\u201d Mr. Ahya said.\nENLARGE\nCountries such as South Korea, India and China could reduce rates next year to take advantage of low inflation, said Deutsche Bank economist Taimur Baig, adding, however, that central banks will be cautious. Pushing rates too low could lead global investors to yank money out of Asian assets, especially if U.S. interest rates begin to rise in 2015.\nAdvertisement\nA few Asian countries, in contrast, have to remain vigilant to keep inflation under control. Indonesia on Tuesday increased its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage point to 7.75%. Indonesia is one of the few places in the region where inflation is poised to accelerate\u2014likely to 7.5% in December from under 5% last month\u2014after President Joko Widodo\u2019s administration Tuesday raised government-controlled fuel prices. Economists have long called for the move, which frees up government money spent on fuel subsidies for infrastructure or social spending.\nIndonesia\u2019s inflation will still be below the 8% level seen at the end of 2013, and many economists expect inflation to moderate again next year.\nSome governments in the region fear Japan-style deflation, in which falling prices start a vicious cycle of reduced consumer spending and business investment.\n\u2018It is extremely imperative that all levers are used to pep up demand.\u2019\n\u2014A. Didar Singh, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce\nJapan recently has gotten prices rising again through fiscal and monetary stimulus. But economists expect inflation will fall below 1% in the next few months, well short of the Bank of Japan \u2019s 2% target.\nIn South Korea, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan repeatedly has warned that the government needs to act aggressively to keep the country from following in Japan\u2019s footsteps.\nWith inflation stuck below 2%, the Bank of Korea reduced interest rates last month after an earlier cut in August. Many economists believe another cut is in store early next year.\nIn Vietnam, inflation is expected to remain below 5% in 2014, its lowest level in decades. \u201cThe current interest rate...should be further cut to support businesses,\u201d said Tran Thanh Son, chief executive of Viet Thai Painting Co., a producer of steel pipes, lights and paints.\nAnd in India, which has long tried to rein in inflation, consumer prices in October rose at 5.5% on year, down from double digits a year ago and the slowest pace since the consumer-price series was introduced in 2012.\nENLARGE\nAsian governments have relied on debt to fuel growth since the U.S. economy stumbled in 2008, and some observers warn that lowering rates could lead companies and households across Asia to take on even more debt.\nTotal debt stood at over 200% of the region\u2019s gross domestic product in 2013, up from 147% in 2007, according to Morgan Stanley.\nMr. Ahya says that while Asian policy makers are cautious on rate cuts for that reason, the risk of inaction is that low inflation makes debts harder to service and cuts corporate profit, further hurting wages and demand.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China, in its third-quarter monetary-policy statement, alluded to the dilemma, saying authorities need to support growth but want to avoid adding to debt levels.\nChina\u2019s inflation was at a five-year low of 1.6% in October, well below the government\u2019s goal of keeping price growth at less than 3.5%.\nThe central bank so far has restricted itself to cutting commercial banks\u2019 reserve requirements to boost lending.

Rupak De Chowdhuri/Reuters <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p> ENLARGE <\/p>\n<p>Inflation rates are falling across Asia, raising expectations that central banks will lower interest rates to help their economies and ease the region&rsquo;s high debt burden.<\/p>\n<p>Consumer-price rises are moderating almost everywhere as the cost of oil and commodities like rice, soybean and sugar drop sharply. While prices are falling partly because of abundant global supply, China&rsquo;s slowing growth is also having a knock-on effect across Asia, reducing demand for the region&rsquo;s exports.<\/p>\n<p>A pickup in the U.S. economy, a bright spot for demand, is counterbalanced by Europe&rsquo;s continued troubles. Japan&rsquo;s fall into a technical recession in the third quarter, meanwhile, could keep prices in the region from rising further.<\/p>\n<p>The risk to Asia is that low inflation becomes entrenched, mirroring Japan&rsquo;s troubles of recent years and making it harder for companies and households to repay debt, said Chetan Ahya, an economist at <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/MS\"> Morgan Stanley <\/a> in Hong Kong. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to cut rates to get out of this problem,&rdquo; Mr. Ahya said.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AM-BG283_APRICE_16U_20141118220014.jpg\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<p> ENLARGE <\/p>\n<p>Countries such as South Korea, India and China could reduce rates next year to take advantage of low inflation, said <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/DBK.XE\"> Deutsche Bank <\/a> economist Taimur Baig, adding, however, that central banks will be cautious. Pushing rates too low could lead global investors to yank money out of Asian assets, especially if U.S. interest rates begin to rise in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisement<\/p>\n<p>A few Asian countries, in contrast, have to remain vigilant to keep inflation under control. Indonesia on Tuesday <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/indonesia-surprises-with-rate-increase-as-fuel-plan-draws-protests-1416332330\">increased its benchmark rate<\/a> by 0.25 percentage point to 7.75%. Indonesia is one of the few places in the region where inflation is poised to accelerate&mdash;likely to 7.5% in December from under 5% last month&mdash;after President Joko Widodo&rsquo;s administration Tuesday <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/indonesia-seen-likely-to-raise-fuel-prices-at-midnight-1416230590\">raised government-controlled fuel prices<\/a>. Economists have long called for the move, which frees up government money spent on fuel subsidies for infrastructure or social spending.<\/p>\n<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s inflation will still be below the 8% level seen at the end of 2013, and many economists expect inflation to moderate again next year.<\/p>\n<p>Some governments in the region fear Japan-style deflation, in which falling prices start a vicious cycle of reduced consumer spending and business investment.<\/p>\n<blockquote> <p> &lsquo;It is extremely imperative that all levers are used to pep up demand.&rsquo; <\/p> &mdash;A. Didar Singh, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce <\/blockquote>\n<p>Japan recently has gotten prices rising again through fiscal and monetary stimulus. But economists expect inflation will fall below 1% in the next few months, well short of the <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/8301.TO\"> Bank of Japan <\/a> &rsquo;s 2% target.<\/p>\n<p>In South Korea, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan repeatedly has warned that the government needs to act aggressively to keep the country from following in Japan&rsquo;s footsteps.<\/p>\n<p>With inflation stuck below 2%, the Bank of Korea reduced interest rates last month after an earlier cut in August. Many economists believe another cut is in store early next year.<\/p>\n<p>In Vietnam, inflation is expected to remain below 5% in 2014, its lowest level in decades. &ldquo;The current interest rate...should be further cut to support businesses,&rdquo; said Tran Thanh Son, chief executive of Viet Thai Painting Co., a producer of steel pipes, lights and paints.<\/p>\n<p>And in India, which has long tried to rein in inflation, consumer prices in October rose at 5.5% on year, down from double digits a year ago and the slowest pace since the consumer-price series was introduced in 2012.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A shopper browses in a shop in Tokyo, where consumers have tightened their purse strings.\" src=\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FP571_aprice_P_20141118153125.jpg\"><\/img><figcaption> A shopper browses in a shop in Tokyo, where consumers have tightened their purse strings. yoshikazu tsuno/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p> ENLARGE <\/p>\n<p>Asian governments have relied on debt to fuel growth since the U.S. economy stumbled in 2008, and some observers warn that lowering rates could lead companies and households across Asia to take on even more debt.<\/p>\n<p>Total debt stood at over 200% of the region&rsquo;s gross domestic product in 2013, up from 147% in 2007, according to Morgan Stanley.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Ahya says that while Asian policy makers are cautious on rate cuts for that reason, the risk of inaction is that low inflation makes debts harder to service and cuts corporate profit, further hurting wages and demand.<\/p>\n<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China, in its third-quarter monetary-policy statement, alluded to the dilemma, saying authorities need to support growth but want to avoid adding to debt levels.<\/p>\n<p>China&rsquo;s inflation was at a five-year low of 1.6% in October, well below the government&rsquo;s goal of keeping price growth at less than 3.5%.<\/p>\n<p>The central bank so far has restricted itself to cutting commercial banks&rsquo; reserve requirements to boost lending. <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/JPM\"> J.P.

The first, Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d argues that mass incarceration \u2014 which dates roughly from President Ronald Reagan's War on Drugs in the 1980s to the present\u2014represents the third phase of African-American oppression in the United States, after slavery and Jim Crow. Alexander documents how the United States came to be the world\u2019s biggest jailer by enacting policies that represented a bipartisan shift in how we address addiction, mental illness, and other non-violent forms of misconduct. Fueled in part by a reaction to civil rights gains and in part by fear of escalating crime, Alexander claims, we enacted tough drug laws, imposed greater mandatory minimum sentences, and ignited a prison boom. Intent can be difficult to prove; impact is irrefutable.\nThe second, Gilbert King\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cDevil in the Grove,\u201d explores the case of four African-American males falsely accused of rape in Lake County, Fla., and the vigilante violence that ensued. At the center of the drama was NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice, who bravely but largely futilely fought in Florida's courts to spare these young men's lives. This took place in 1949, before Brown v. Board of Education (a Marshall legal triumph) and before an organized national movement to combat the Jim Crow segregation laws. The national press did not cover the proceedings.\nSpurred on by these chapters in American history, I continued to explore our country's system of crime and punishment. What struck me was not only how expensive, ineffective, and racially biased it is, and how difficult it is to find anyone, liberal or conservative, who defends the status quo. But also how our condition has become taken for granted. Other American crises \u2014 soaring health-care costs, the failure of public education \u2014 typically lead to public debate and legislative action. But the spike in mass incarceration appears to have had the opposite effect: The general public has become inured to the overuse of solitary confinement, the widespread incidence of prison rape and the mixing of teens and adults in hardcore prisons. The more people we put behind bars, it seemed, the more the issue receded from the public consciousness.\nThe Marshall Project represents our attempt to elevate the criminal justice issue to one of national urgency, and to help spark a national conversation about reform. I named our organization after Justice Marshall simply because he embodies the principles we hold dear. He was scholarly, he was courageous, and he fiercely believed that the U.S. Constitution was the template to secure civil rights for all.\nThe Marshall Project will practice open-minded, fact-based journalism without fear or favor. Our editor, Bill Keller, has assembled a first-class team of reporters and editors dedicated to excellence, nonpartisan reporting, and innovation. We are a journalism organization because we think that journalism, done honestly and well, has infinite power to drive change. One need only look to the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements to appreciate how important journalists were in shaping public opinion. We do not need to be strident or ideological or selective in our use of facts . When the truth is as disturbing as it was in the segregated South, or in Vietnam, or today's prisons and courts, truthful reporting can have a powerful impact. We will explore what is working as well as what is broken, and where the potential exists for meaningful reform. Our commentary section will be written by individuals whose views encompass a broad range of perspectives. Our board of advisers, for example, includes both the inspirational civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson from the Equal Justice Initiative, and the conservative thinker Marc Levin from Right on Crime, both of whom have devoted their careers to making our system more humane and effective.\nBeing nonpartisan is not the same as being neutral. We approach the issue with the view \u2014 shared by a growing number of conservatives and liberals \u2014 that our system needs serious rethinking. Thank you for your interest in The Marshall Project, and please do not hesitate to tell us what you think.\nA Letter from Our Editor\nIn March I left The New York Times after 30 years there as a reporter, editor and columnist to help launch something new: a non-profit newsroom devoted to coverage of the American criminal justice system.\nIn the ensuing months we have assembled a diverse team of journalists, set in motion a wide range of reporting projects, built a website to serve as a worthy stage for our journalism, and begun to forge partnerships with a range of established media organizations that will amplify our voice.\nWe are not here to promote any particular agenda or ideology. But we have a sense of mission. We want to move the discussion of our institutions of justice \u2014 law enforcement, courts, prisons, probation \u2014 to a more central place in our national dialogue. We believe, as the great jurist Thurgood Marshall did, that protection under the law is the most fundamental civil right in a free society. Yet, by the numbers, the United States is a global outlier, with a prison population matched by no nation except, possibly, North Korea, with a justice system that disproportionately afflicts communities of need and of color, with a corrections regime that rarely corrects.\nWe aim to accomplish our mission through probing, fair-minded journalism, combining investigative rigor, careful analysis, and lively storytelling. We will examine the failings of our criminal justice system \u2014 but also test promising reforms. While a number of news organizations are doing distinguished reporting on crime and punishment, the journalistic energy devoted to this kind of reporting, time consuming and expensive as it is, has been sapped by the financial traumas of the news industry. Our aim is both to restore some of that lost energy and to be a catalyst for coverage elsewhere. We will publish the fruits of our reporting here and expand our audience by collaborating with first-rate newspapers, magazines, broadcasters and other online news sites.\nIn addition to our original reporting, we will compile the most interesting news and commentary from around the world of criminal justice, distributing our findings in our daily email, and offer this site as a hub for debate and accord. We are nonpartisan and nonideological, which means you will find here the voices of progressives and conservatives, centrists and provocateurs. As it happens, criminal justice is one of the few areas of public policy where there is a significant patch of common ground between right and left.\nWe are also nonprofit, dependent on the generosity of foundations and individuals. Our website and email are free of charge, but we invite you to click the \u201cdonate\u201d button if you find The Marshall Project to be of interest and value. And join the conversation on social media or through our Letters to the Editor feature.\nCode of Ethics\nThis code, which is taken with a few amendments from the Society of Professional Journalists, lays out the guidelines by which we intend to run our newsroom and assure the integrity of our journalism. Extraordinary circumstances may occasionally call for exceptions to these rules, and situations will surely arise that are ambiguous. Therefore the first rule is: when in doubt, ask.\nThe Marshall Project aims to produce journalism that is accurate in its facts, fair in its interpretation and presentation, and independent in its judgments \u2013 in a word, trustworthy. Because journalism is produced by human beings, we will sometimes get things wrong. So our second rule is, when we fall short of our expectations, we will promptly and prominently acknowledge our mistakes and correct them.\nThe Marshall Project is a nonprofit organization that depends on individuals and foundations for funding, and our journalistic independence extends to the organizations and individuals who support us. Donors should not expect preferential coverage, and they should understand the possibility that we may publish content with which they disagree. Readers should know that in the event we write about our funders or members of our board of directors or advisory board, our relationship will be fully disclosed.\nJournalists working for The Marshall Project should:\nTest the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible.\nDiligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing.\nIdentify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on sources' reliability.\nAlways question sources\u2019 motives before promising anonymity. Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information. Keep promises.\nMake certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites, and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.\nNever distort the content of news photos or video. Image enhancement for technical clarity is always permissible. Label montages and photo illustrations.\nAvoid misleading re-enactments or staged news events. If re-enactment is necessary to tell a story, label it.\nAvoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information except when traditional open methods will not yield information vital to the public. Use of such methods should be explained as part of the story.\nNever plagiarize.\nTell the story of the diversity and magnitude of the human experience boldly, even when it is unpopular to do so.\nExamine their own cultural values and avoid imposing those values on others.\nAvoid stereotyping by race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, geography, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or social status.\nSupport the open exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.\nGive voice to the voiceless; official and unofficial sources of information can be equally valid.\nDistinguish between advocacy and news reporting. Analysis and commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or context.\nDistinguish news from advertising and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two.\nRecognize a special obligation to ensure that the public's business is conducted in the open and that government records are open to inspection.\nMinimize Harm\nEthical journalists treat sources, subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect.\nJournalists should:\nShow compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage. Use special sensitivity when dealing with children and inexperienced sources or subjects.\nBe sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or grief.\nRecognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance.\nRecognize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than do public officials and others who seek power, influence, or attention. Only an overriding public need can justify intrusion into anyone\u2019s privacy.\nShow good taste. Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity.\nBe cautious about identifying juvenile suspects or victims of sex crimes.\nBe judicious about naming criminal suspects before the formal filing of charges.\nBalance a criminal suspect\u2019s fair trial rights with the public\u2019s right to be informed.\nAct Independently\nJournalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public's right to know.\nJournalists should:\nAvoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived.\nRemain free of associations and activities that may compromise integrity or damage credibility.\nRefuse gifts, favors, fees, free travel, and special treatment, and shun secondary employment, political involvement, public office and service in community organizations if they compromise journalistic integrity.\nDisclose unavoidable conflicts.\nBe vigilant and courageous about holding those with power accountable.\nDeny favored treatment to advertisers and special interests and resist their pressure to influence news coverage.\nBe wary of sources offering information for favors or money; avoid bidding for news.","title":"About","diffbotUri":"article|3|1641476063","pageUrl":"http://t.co/OtttMkjKKL","humanLanguage":"en","html":"<h1>Mission Statement<\/h1>\n<h1>Contact Us<\/h1>\n<p>All media and interview requests should be directed to Communications Director, Ruth Baldwin, <a href=\"mailto:rbaldwin@themarshallproject.org\"> rbaldwin@themarshallproject.org<\/a>, 212-803-5270.<\/p>\n<h3>Contact a staffer<\/h3>\n<p>Staff members can be reached <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/people\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h1>A Letter from Our Founder<\/h1>\n<h3>By <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/neil-barsky/\">Neil Barsky<\/a>, 11.15.2014<\/h3>\n<p>The seeds of The Marshall Project were planted a few years ago after I read two books.

Donors should not expect preferential coverage, and they should understand the possibility that we may publish content with which they disagree. Readers should know that in the event we write about our funders or members of our board of directors or advisory board, our relationship will be fully disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>Journalists working for The Marshall Project should:<\/p>\n<p>Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible.<\/p>\n<p>Diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing.<\/p>\n<p>Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on sources' reliability.<\/p>\n<p>Always question sources&rsquo; motives before promising anonymity. Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information. Keep promises.<\/p>\n<p>Make certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites, and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.<\/p>\n<p>Never distort the content of news photos or video. Image enhancement for technical clarity is always permissible. Label montages and photo illustrations.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid misleading re-enactments or staged news events. If re-enactment is necessary to tell a story, label it.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information except when traditional open methods will not yield information vital to the public. Use of such methods should be explained as part of the story.<\/p>\n<p>Never plagiarize.<\/p>\n<p>Tell the story of the diversity and magnitude of the human experience boldly, even when it is unpopular to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Examine their own cultural values and avoid imposing those values on others.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid stereotyping by race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, geography, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or social status.<\/p>\n<p>Support the open exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.<\/p>\n<p>Give voice to the voiceless; official and unofficial sources of information can be equally valid.<\/p>\n<p>Distinguish between advocacy and news reporting. Analysis and commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or context.<\/p>\n<p>Distinguish news from advertising and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two.<\/p>\n<p>Recognize a special obligation to ensure that the public's business is conducted in the open and that government records are open to inspection.<\/p>\n<h3>Minimize Harm<\/h3>\n<p>Ethical journalists treat sources, subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect.<\/p>\n<p>Journalists should:<\/p>\n<p>Show compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage. Use special sensitivity when dealing with children and inexperienced sources or subjects.<\/p>\n<p>Be sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or grief.<\/p>\n<p>Recognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance.<\/p>\n<p>Recognize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than do public officials and others who seek power, influence, or attention. Only an overriding public need can justify intrusion into anyone&rsquo;s privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Show good taste. Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity.<\/p>\n<p>Be cautious about identifying juvenile suspects or victims of sex crimes.<\/p>\n<p>Be judicious about naming criminal suspects before the formal filing of charges.<\/p>\n<p>Balance a criminal suspect&rsquo;s fair trial rights with the public&rsquo;s right to be informed.<\/p>\n<h3>Act Independently<\/h3>\n<p>Journalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public's right to know.<\/p>\n<p>Journalists should:<\/p>\n<p>Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived.<\/p>\n<p>Remain free of associations and activities that may compromise integrity or damage credibility.<\/p>\n<p>Refuse gifts, favors, fees, free travel, and special treatment, and shun secondary employment, political involvement, public office and service in community organizations if they compromise journalistic integrity.<\/p>\n<p>Disclose unavoidable conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Be vigilant and courageous about holding those with power accountable.<\/p>\n<p>Deny favored treatment to advertisers and special interests and resist their pressure to influence news coverage.<\/p>\n<p>Be wary of sources offering information for favors or money; avoid bidding for news.<\/p>","date":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 00:00:00 GMT","type":"article","resolvedPageUrl":"https://www.themarshallproject.org/about#founder","docId":157780227901,"gburl":"http://t.co/OtttMkjKKL-diffbotxyz1953770393","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1420322875,"timestamp":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 22:07:55 GMT"}

It can be a strategy to build a viable company in this or that niche, but not much more.\nI consider myself a contrarian and I usually say what I think, no matter conventions, but I hesitated writing this post. Few people whose opinions on innovations and entrepreneurship I truly respect expressed clearly opposite judgment. Fred Wilson during his LeWeb 2013 speech, or Marc Andreessen in one of his tweetstorms, or Andy Weissman in blog post and Sean Park in the comment to this post.\nHowever, I think they are wrong and I decided to present my humble opinion.\nReasons to stay bundled\nThere are few reasons why bundled financial services is more sustainable business model than unbundled:\nNote, that all arguments below concern disruptive scale, they don\u2019t describe the entire market and it is a huge one, so some ventures can exist and grow using minority of exclusions. Another thing is that evaluating pace of disruption you shouldn\u2019t mix market share or growth in number of customers with market share in revenues.\nNature of financial needs\nFinancial products are only enablers for final needs. Usually customers don\u2019t shop around for the best offer of financial product, they look for a convenient and acceptable way to meet their target desire/aspiration/must. They concentrate on different things than conditions of a complex agreement, unless it is a really significant deal. They double check only if the offer they get is not convenient or not acceptable.\nConvenience and friction\nPeople are getting more and more demanding in terms of convenience. Friction can kill the most attractive value proposition. An effort of fulfilling 10 fields can be perceived higher than tens of basis points of discount. This is an increasing trend. Having all financial products in one institution is an optimal solution for convenience. Seeking for a new provider or even constantly purchasing different types of products in different institutions creates friction.\nCross-selling\nCross-selling is the most powerful sales mechanism in banking. Customers buy majority of products in their main bank (see e.g. EY Global Consumer Banking Survey 2014 page 7 and entire report). Yes, this proportion is changing, but I think that it is connected with strategic choices of targeting milk cows, which I described in this post.\nUnbundled competitors have two important drawbacks. The first is occasional usage; when customers use given product once every few years, like consumer loan, cross-border transfer or investment loan, everyone except for the main bank (or two) has to acquire them each time and spend money on it. The second drawback is much lower possibility to create needs based on customer insight.\nSpecific sales processes\nThings look a bit different in processes/products with a specific point of sales, for example car loans, co-branded cards or e-commerce payments. I consider this specificity as the only significant occasion for unbundling, but still without any competitive advantage, just based on natural gap between the niche and the core of the market. This gap can be a seed of disruption only when there is some defensibility mechanism like partnerships or the Network Effect. Otherwise, when the niche grows and starts to be attractive, traditional banks will enter and have better position.\nMarketing and trust\nOne of the most important elements of marketing in banking is building trust. Trust is a pre-requisite for any further consideration in purchase decision making process. To build it you need banking license and/or brand awareness. Both cost a lot. Creating trust and utilizing only a small piece of what it enables would be a mismanagement.\nIT synergies\nSignificant part of IT can be shared between different financial services. Existing revenues from one segment, product or service subsidize development for secondary objectives. Often newcomers are more agile, innovative and technical savvy, but I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with bundling vs. unbundling.\nRisk management\nRisk management is another important area in which bundled bank can be better than non-bank entrant. From KYC and frauds detection, to underwriting using more data points, to collection, to ALM risks like liquidity and interest rate. Similarly to IT synergies, in some cases innovative ventures seem more efficient (to be proven in low season) and similarly it has nothing to do with unbundling.\nSummary\nThe economics of bundled financial services are better thanks to:\nlow price sensitiveness of significant part of customers;\nconvenience, frictionless and margin which can be charged for it;\nshared expenses for building trust;\nreduction of costs of acquisition by cross-selling;\nIT synergies;\nbetter risk management.\nDue to the better economics, allowable acquisition cost for banks is higher and it creates a sort of entry barier.\nIt is true that currently challengers, newcomers and non-bank entrants can offer better prices, conditions and user experience than banks in many areas of financial services. However, for me it is related to the fact that banks don\u2019t have to compete on prices that much (more about it here) and generally don\u2019t fight for early-adopters.\nThis price advantage shouldn\u2019t be mixed with efficiency advantage and is not a sign of structural competitive edge. It is not like in entertainment, communication, hotel business, short-distance transportation, retail or education, where innovations improve economics.\nIn my opinion, the biggest influence that fintech unbundling disruptors might have on the market is to force banks to reduce pricing or improve quality. They are not capable of displacing them. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean that some successful companies cannot be created and exited on the way.\nYbanking solution\nOur ambition is to disrupt banking market. We see a lot of potential and exposure for disruptive innovations. However, we think that it should be done in cooperation with fully fledged banks and using different means than unbundling.","title":"Banks.

Now it has more than 100,000 computers, and has recently overtaken well-established hosting companies such as Rackspace and Hetzner, despite their considerable head starts over DigitalOcean.\nDec 2012\nApr 2013\nOct 2013\nApr 2014\nOct 2014\nComputers\n138\n2,821\n22,491\n63,436\n108,489\nActive Sites\n237\n5,547\n66,230\n161,994\n286,342\nHostnames\n328\n73,827\n336,615\n1,522,539\n2,044,827\nDigitalOcean provides SSD-backed virtual computers (called \"droplets\") which are available at relatively low hourly rates, making it an attractive hosting location for hobbyists and large companies alike. Coupled with promotional voucher codes which offer free credit to new users, these low costs have likely played a big part in DigitalOcean's rapid growth. If current growth rates persist, DigitalOcean is likely to become the third largest hosting company within the next few months, and could well be biting at the heels of second-place OVH early next year.\nOnly Amazon has grown faster over the past 12 months, putting its lead well out of DigitalOcean's reach \u2014 at least for the time being. DigitalOcean's attractive pricing has no doubt been putting pressure on Amazon, who introduced a new general purpose instance type for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) before announcing lower-than-expected Q2 results. The new \"t2.micro\" instances are the lowest-cost option at Amazon, costing $0.013 per hour, but do not include persistent storage by default.\nThese changes have brought the virtual hardware costs of Amazon EC2 almost on par with DigitalOcean, where a droplet with 1GB RAM and 30 GB of SSD storage currently costs $10 per month. A comparable t2.micro instance on Amazon EC2 would cost around $12 per month. However, the biggest difference is likely to manifest itself in the cost of bandwidth: The $10 DigitalOcean droplet includes 2TB of data transfer, whereas Amazon charges up to $0.12 per GB of outbound data transfer beyond the first GB. If both were used to serve 2TB of data to the internet, DigitalOcean's droplet cost would still only be $10, whereas Amazon's would skyrocket to more than $250.\nWith price wars in full swing, it will be interesting to see how other hosting companies try to compete in this rapidly growing market. DigitalOcean already offers a cheaper, less powerful droplet at $5/month, but even lower spec virtual machines can be found for significantly less \u2013 Atlantic.net, for example, offers instances with 256MB RAM and 10GB of storage from only $0.99/month, and Amazon's AWS Free Tier provides up to 12 months of free, hands-on experience with several AWS services, including up to 750 hours per month of t2.micro usage.\nWebsite growth\nThe number of websites hosted at DigitalOcean has followed a similar trend to its computer growth since mid-2013. More than two million websites are now hosted at DigitalOcean \u2014 a gain of more than 500% over the past 12 months. Around 14% of these sites are active, giving a surprisingly low ratio of active sites to computers (2.6:1).\nIn comparison, Amazon hosts an average of 8 active sites per computer, while Rackspace has 12. Just over half of DigitalOcean's web facing computers host only one website each.\nDigitalOcean's one-click apps may account for many of the computers which host only one website, as these allow customers to rapidly deploy a single application on a single Ubuntu droplet without significant knowledge of system administration. Popular web applications such as WordPress, Magento, Drupal and Django can be deployed, and the uptake appears to be significant \u2014 for instance, Netcraft's survey found that more than 23% of the active sites hosted at DigitalOcean are running WordPress, compared with less than 10% of all other active sites around the world.\nCloud hosting locations\nBoth DigitalOcean and Amazon provide a choice of data centers around the world, but the countries in which these are located do not completely overlap. For example, DigitalOcean droplets can now be provisioned in its London data center (LON1), which was introduced in July 2014 following requests from customers.\nAmazon does not provide EC2 hosting in the UK, giving DigitalOcean a distinct advantage in this particular cloud hosting market. Despite being relatively new to the UK, DigitalOcean already ranks 22nd in terms of web-facing computers, and could soon become one of the largest hosting companies in the UK if its growth in Singapore is anything to go by. Its Singapore data center was opened in February 2014, and already has 6,600 web-facing computers, which is second only to Amazon's 12,900 computers \u2014 this is no mean feat considering Amazon has had data centers in Singapore since April 2010.\nDigitalOcean added a London data center in July 2014\nConversely, Amazon has a distinct advantage in Latin America, where it has the third largest number of web-facing computers. Despite receiving over 2,000 requests to open a Brazilian data center (four times as many requests as there were for a UK one), DigitalOcean does not look set to follow Amazon's footsteps any time soon: Brazilian import taxes would add around 100% to the cost of hardware, visa constraints would hamper the ability to review suitable data centers, and bandwidth not only costs more, but also has limited connectivity.\nNetcraft provides information on internet infrastructure, including the hosting industry, and web content technologies.

Now it has more than 100,000 computers, and has recently overtaken well-established hosting companies such as <a href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/\">Rackspace<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.hetzner.de/en/\">Hetzner<\/a>, despite their considerable head starts over DigitalOcean.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"DigitalOcean growth\" src=\"http://news.netcraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/digitaloceangrowth1.png\"><\/img><figcaption>Growth at DigitalOcean<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<table> <tbody><tr>  <th>Dec 2012<\/th> <th>Apr 2013<\/th> <th>Oct 2013<\/th> <th>Apr 2014<\/th> <th>Oct 2014<\/th> <\/tr> <tr> <th>Computers<\/th> <td><b>138<\/b><\/td> <td><b>2,821<\/b><\/td> <td><b>22,491<\/b><\/td> <td><b>63,436<\/b><\/td> <td><b>108,489<\/b><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <th>Active Sites<\/th> <td>237<\/td> <td>5,547<\/td> <td>66,230<\/td> <td>161,994<\/td> <td>286,342<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <th>Hostnames<\/th> <td>328<\/td> <td>73,827<\/td> <td>336,615<\/td> <td>1,522,539<\/td> <td>2,044,827<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table>\n<p>DigitalOcean provides SSD-backed virtual computers (called &quot;droplets&quot;) which are available at relatively low hourly rates, making it an attractive hosting location for hobbyists and large companies alike. Coupled with promotional voucher codes which offer free credit to new users, these low costs have likely played a big part in DigitalOcean's rapid growth. If current growth rates persist, DigitalOcean is likely to become the third largest hosting company within the next few months, and could well be biting at the heels of second-place OVH early next year.<\/p>\n<p>Only Amazon has grown faster over the past 12 months, putting its lead well out of DigitalOcean's reach &mdash; at least for the time being. DigitalOcean's attractive pricing has no doubt been putting pressure on Amazon, who introduced a new general purpose instance type for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">EC2<\/a>) before announcing <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140724006396/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Quarter-Sales-23-19.34-Billion#.VDU7chYknLH\">lower-than-expected<\/a> Q2 results. The new &quot;t2.micro&quot; instances are the lowest-cost option at Amazon, costing $0.013 per hour, but do not include persistent storage by default.<\/p>\n<p>These changes have brought the virtual hardware costs of Amazon EC2 almost on par with DigitalOcean, where a droplet with 1GB RAM and 30 GB of SSD storage currently costs $10 per month. A comparable t2.micro instance on Amazon EC2 would cost around $12 per month. However, the biggest difference is likely to manifest itself in the cost of bandwidth: The $10 DigitalOcean droplet includes 2TB of data transfer, whereas Amazon charges up to $0.12 per GB of outbound data transfer beyond the first GB. If both were used to serve 2TB of data to the internet, DigitalOcean's droplet cost would still only be $10, whereas Amazon's would skyrocket to more than $250.<\/p>\n<p>With price wars in full swing, it will be interesting to see how other hosting companies try to compete in this rapidly growing market. DigitalOcean already offers a cheaper, less powerful droplet at $5/month, but even lower spec virtual machines can be found for significantly less &ndash; <a href=\"http://atlantic.net\">Atlantic.net<\/a>, for example, offers instances with 256MB RAM and 10GB of storage from only $0.99/month, and Amazon's <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/free/\">AWS Free Tier<\/a> provides up to 12 months of free, hands-on experience with several AWS services, including up to 750 hours per month of t2.micro usage.<\/p>\n<h3>Website growth<\/h3>\n<p>The number of websites hosted at DigitalOcean has followed a similar trend to its computer growth since mid-2013. More than two million websites are now hosted at DigitalOcean &mdash; a gain of more than 500% over the past 12 months. Around 14% of these sites are active, giving a surprisingly low ratio of active sites to computers (2.6:1).<\/p>\n<p>In comparison, Amazon hosts an average of 8 active sites per computer, while Rackspace has 12. Just over half of DigitalOcean's web facing computers host only one website each.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"DigitalOcean growth (logarithmic scale)\" src=\"http://news.netcraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/digitaloceangrowthlogscale1.png\"><\/img><figcaption>DigitalOcean growth (logarithmic scale)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>DigitalOcean's <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/\">one-click apps<\/a> may account for many of the computers which host only one website, as these allow customers to rapidly deploy a single application on a single Ubuntu droplet without significant knowledge of system administration. Popular web applications such as WordPress, Magento, Drupal and Django can be deployed, and the uptake appears to be significant &mdash; for instance, Netcraft's survey found that more than 23% of the active sites hosted at DigitalOcean are running WordPress, compared with less than 10% of all other active sites around the world.<\/p>\n<h3>Cloud hosting locations<\/h3>\n<p>Both DigitalOcean and Amazon provide a choice of data centers around the world, but the countries in which these are located do not completely overlap. For example, DigitalOcean droplets can now be provisioned in its London data center (<a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/introducing-our-london-region/\">LON1<\/a>), which was introduced in July 2014 following <a href=\"https://digitalocean.uservoice.com/forums/136585-digitalocean/suggestions/3069422-add-uk-data-center\">requests from customers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon does not provide EC2 hosting in the UK, giving DigitalOcean a distinct advantage in this particular cloud hosting market. Despite being relatively new to the UK, DigitalOcean already ranks 22nd in terms of web-facing computers, and could soon become one of the largest hosting companies in the UK if its growth in Singapore is anything to go by. Its Singapore data center was opened in February 2014, and <i>already<\/i> has 6,600 web-facing computers, which is second only to Amazon's 12,900 computers &mdash; this is no mean feat considering Amazon has had data centers in Singapore since <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2010/04/29/announcing-asia-pacific-singapore-region/\">April 2010<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><i>DigitalOcean added a London data center in July 2014<\/i><\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"DigitalOcean regions - now includes London\" src=\"http://news.netcraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/regions.png\"><\/img><figcaption>DigitalOcean regions - now includes London<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Conversely, Amazon has a distinct advantage in Latin America, where it has the third largest number of web-facing computers. Despite receiving over 2,000 requests to open a <a href=\"http://digitalocean.uservoice.com/forums/136585-digitalocean/suggestions/3614876-brazilian-datacenter\">Brazilian data center<\/a> (four times as many requests as there were for a UK one), DigitalOcean does not look set to follow Amazon's footsteps <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/introducing-our-london-region/#comment-1486017418\">any time soon<\/a>: Brazilian import taxes would add around 100% to the cost of hardware, visa constraints would hamper the ability to review suitable data centers, and bandwidth not only costs more, but also has limited connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>Netcraft provides information on internet infrastructure, including the hosting industry, and web content technologies.

The underlying concern, he said, is with &ldquo;unjust enrichment&rdquo; and economic exploitation of others.<\/p>\n<p>The statement from Islamic State&rsquo;s Treasury Department said the new currency would be &ldquo;far removed from the tyrannical monetary system that was imposed on the Muslims and was a reason for their enslavement and impoverishment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that the militants have been funding their operations by <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-funds-push-into-syria-and-iraq-with-labyrinthine-oil-smuggling-operation-1410826325\">smuggling their oil into Turkey<\/a>&nbsp;for sale on the black market.&nbsp;Chip Poncy, a former Treasury Department official who helped develop the U.S. government&rsquo;s strategy for combating terrorist financing, said the leaders of the Islamic State are unlikely to suddenly demand payment for that oil in their new currency.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In order to remain anonymous, ISIL may most likely be settling transactions for smuggled oil in U.S. dollars or the local currency of a cash-intensive economy,&rdquo; said Mr. Poncy, now a partner at The Financial Integrity Network.&nbsp;&rdquo;But it is also possible that ISIL is settling these transactions in more sophisticated trade-based or third party repayment schemes whereby it is paid in other products or in third party wires through front companies, locally or abroad.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And coin collectors in the U.S., take note: Owning one of the new gold coins would put you in legally dubious territory.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Legally speaking you&rsquo;d have a pretty good case that&rsquo;s transacting in ISIL currency would be prohibited as engaging in transactions in which a designating terrorist organization has a controlling interest,&rdquo; said Mr. Poncy.<\/p>\n<p><em>&ndash;Tatyana Shumsky contributed to this article.<\/em><\/p>","date":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 00:00:00 GMT","type":"article","resolvedPageUrl":"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/11/14/islamic-state-to-mint-gold-coins/","docId":240111679250,"gburl":"http://t.co/Eih6FDjukv-diffbotxyz3179056805","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1420309194,"timestamp":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 18:19:54 GMT"}

That\u2019s the first time hiring crossed the 5 million threshold since December 2007, the month that the recession officially started. Last month, 2.8 million people quit a job, the most since April 2008.\nThe report on labor market turnover is closely followed by the Federal Reserve, where the report is watched for signs that the labor market is finally healing. The level of quits has been singled out by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as an indicator of worker\u2019s confidence in the economy.\nThe report tracks the various reasons people leave jobs, and this shows an increasingly favorable mix. In September, 57.5% of people who left their jobs did so of their own volition. Only 34.4% were laid off. An additional 8.1% left their jobs either due to retirement, death or disability, a share that\u2019s held roughly constant for the past decade.\nThat\u2019s a sharp turnaround from a few years ago. During the worst of the recession, more than 55% of job separations were involuntary layoffs and discharges and as few as 37% of departures were voluntary.\nThe number of people laid off from jobs remained near record lows in September, with about 1.6 million laid off, according to the report. That corresponds with a separate report this morning from the Labor Department, showing initial weekly jobless claims for the week of Nov. 8 of 290,000. Jobless claims have recorded the longest stretch since 2000 of claims below 300,000.\nThe level of hiring shows that employers, too, are gaining confidence in the economy enough to bolster their payrolls.\nJob openings declined to 4.7 million in September from 4.9 million in August. Job openings in August were the highest since 2001, indicating that this component of the JOLTS report is also near one of the best readings in years.\nRelated coverage:\nGet WSJ economic analysis delivered to your inbox:\nSign up for the WSJ's Grand Central, a daily report on global central banking\nSign up for the Real Time Economics daily summary","pageUrl":"http://t.co/AxxmvNp0tX","humanLanguage":"en","type":"article","date":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 00:00:00 GMT","resolvedPageUrl":"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/11/13/number-of-people-starting-and-quitting-jobs-climbs-to-highest-in-more-than-six-years/","author":"Josh Zumbrun","title":"Number of People Starting and Quitting Jobs Climbs to Highest in More Than Six Years","diffbotUri":"article|3|-851295250","images":[{"diffbotUri":"image|3|2109588867","naturalHeight":369,"primary":true,"naturalWidth":553,"url":"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FN544_turnov_G_20141113101907.jpg"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|1623448793","naturalHeight":369,"naturalWidth":553,"url":"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FN593_whylea_G_20141113113119.jpg"}],"html":"<p>The number of people being hired for jobs and the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs each climbed to the highest level in more than six years, according to a <strong>Labor Department<\/strong> report this morning.<\/p>\n<p>Over 5 million people were hired in September, according to the Labor Department&rsquo;s monthly <strong>Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey<\/strong>, known as <strong>JOLTS<\/strong>.
